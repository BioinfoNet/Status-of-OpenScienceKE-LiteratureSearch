# **The Position of Kenya's Institutions on Open Sceince and Open Research.**
Open Science advocates for freely available, collaborative research of high standard that is reproducible and peer-reviewed and can be developed used by the public.. It involves several facets of open research which are open access, open source (codes), open data, open software, open educational resources, open learning.  Kenya has several public and private universities and also several local and international research instituions and they have embraced the open research at different degrees and in different ways. This report zeros in on a sample few from each category. The University of Nairobi (UoN), Kenyatta University (KU)and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) will represent the public universities while the private ones include the African Nazarene Univesity (ANU), Strathmore University and Catholic University of East Africa (CUEA). The local research instituions will be represented by the Kenya Agricultural Livestork Research Organisation(KALRO), the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and two regulatory bodies: National Commision of Science Technology and Innovation (NACOSTI) and Commission of University Education(CUE). The international research instituions on focus are International Livestork Research Institute (ILRI) and International Center of Insect Physiology and Entomology (ICIPE). 

## **Public Universities**
UoN online library hosts the [institutional repository](http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/) and the [Open Access Resource](http://uonlibrary.uonbi.ac.ke/node/3304) which provide access to open access journals,  articles, books, databases, papers, among other resources. The open science fever has spread the most in UoN since it is so far the only  Kenyan public university to implement open access in the university policy. In 2012, UoN Open Access Policy took effect. The most intriguing point in the policy is the requirement of all stakeholders to deposit their research work into the University repository. Thus, providing exposure of their research innovations and research findings. Their work is further protected by the UoN 2013 Plagiarism Policy that advocates for attribution and against plagiarism all other forms of unethical research practices related to intellectual rights. Every year, during the International Open Access week, UoN organise workshops to sensitize the public on Open Science. For instance, [Open Access Week 2015](https://www.slideshare.net/CIARD_/university-of-nairobi-open-access-initiatives) and [Open Access Week 2016](http://www.uonbi.ac.ke/content/library-open-dayopen-access-week). UoN houses the Kenya Education Network (KENET) which contributes to open science by providing several services such as High perfomance computing, virtual computers, high-speed internet, well-equipped conference rooms for use for trainings, hackathons, and other educational and research activities to universities, research and corporate bodies. KU has an [Institutional Repository](http://ir-library.ku.ac.ke/) and an [Open Access Database](http://library.ku.ac.ke/open-access-databases/) which have links to open acess journals, courseWare and e-books, all within the university library. The university also commemmorates the Open Access Week e.g in [In 2016](https://www.ku.ac.ke/ku/item/365-library-open-week) and utilizes the week to create awareness about open science. JKUAT uniquely has a [Center of Excellence and Open Data](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/directorates/iceod/) with a sub task force iODaV that advocates for various open science principles. Some include promoting innovations based open research data  and support and promoting conformity woth open data principles,standards and JORD policy. JKUAT also conducts Open Access awareness workshops during the international Open Access Week e.g [OA Workshop 2010](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/open-access-week-at-jkuat/) and [OS Week 2017](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/free-access-information-still-challenge-africa/)  

## **Private Univesities**
ANU approach to open access is slow but sure with the addition of a [selected Institutional Repository](https://www.anu.ac.ke/library/e-resources/selected-institutional-repository/) within the new Grace Roles library and an [E-Resource Center](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwii-ZyTsJfdAhWDyIUKHZWKAXgQFjACegQICRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anu.ac.ke%2Flibrary%2Fe-resources%2F&usg=AOvVaw3rwOY2_6ZGO3EF7UzLQpz8) for free access to journals and other open educational resources. Strathmore University and Catholic University of East Africa have Institutional repositories, [Strathmore Digital Repository](https://su-plus.strathmore.edu/) and [CUEA Open Access Databases](http://ir.cuea.edu/html/joomla/index.php/open-access-databases) which provide access to free journals, books, papers, articles and other open educational resources. The little know Rift Valley Institute provides a safe haven for all known hard copy historical records of the nation, people and culture of Sudan especially South Sudan. It also manages the online [Sudan Open Archive](https://www.sudanarchive.net/).

The above universities provide open and distance e-learning (ODeL). This learning is partially open learning since they use open educational resources which are freely available and various barriers such as age and distance are removed. However, students still pay for these modules and some are required to produce certificates of previous education. This beats the essence of open learning. True open learning is free and background education checks are ommitted. Ideal open learning modules include Coursera and CodeCamp. One is given an authentic and internationally recognised certificate upon successful completion.

## **Research Institutions**
ILRI has embraced open science at an advanced level. It has a [Repository](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/1) and several Open Access policies: [Strategy on Research Publishing](http://hdl.handle.net/10568/17220), [Research Publishing Procedure 6: Open Access](http://hdl.handle.net/10568/63491) which emphasizes on high quality and reproducible science published in peer-reviewed open access journals and open-licensed, [ILRI policy on Open Access](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/63498) and [Intellectual Assets](http://hdl.handle.net/10568/34091), among others. [This link](https://www.ilri.org/open) lists ILRI's numerous workshops, trainings and blog posts that are related to open science and open access. In addition, ILRI has an [Open Data Portal](http://data.ilri.org/) for access to Open Source platforms.ICIPE and KALRO both have Repositories that gives access to the institutions' research publications. They can find in these links: [ICIPE Digital Repository](http://34.250.91.188:8080/xmlui/), [KALRO Repository](http://www.kalro.org:8080/repository/). KALRO occasionally has talks about open science such as [this one](https://www.slideshare.net/CIARD_/open-data-and-open-science-in-agriculture-management) KEMRI in affiliation with Wellcome Trust, or in short, KWTRP, has a [gateway](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/gateways/KEMRI) from the main [Wellcome Trust Open Research platform](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/). It has been mainly designed to provide a repository for KWTRP research work and to make it freely available to the public.  

### **Regulatory Bodies**
National Commision of Science Technology and Innovation (NACOSTI) is the national regulatory body that facilitates the promotion, coordination and regulation of Science, Technology and Innovation in Kenya. It is more famously known for its management of National Research Fund (NRF) which provides funding for various scientific research activities in the country especially universities. On the other hand, Commission of University Education regulates on the quality of education offered by Kenyan institutions of higher learning. CUE has an [Open Access Resource ](http://www.cue.or.ke/index.php/services/library-information-services/open-access-resources). These bodies surprisingly do not have any mention or implemented policies geered towards promotion of open science or open access. This article recommends that open science, particulary on high quality, peer-reviewed, reproducible, collaborative sceince and intellectual rights to research should be coordinated by these bodies as part of their quality assurance and policies guidelines to Kenyan's institutions. 

The progress towards complete legally embedded practice of open science in Kenyan instituitions is hopeful and progressive. It is up to the new researchers to embrace it full what had already been pioneered in their own resaerch journey by learning, practicing and sharing open science principles in their work.
