	abstract = {This study seeks to understand the existing interactions between actors of the Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI), and how the actors’ interests are aligning to achieve openness and transparency of government operations. This study is based on the Callon’s moments of translation framework, which helps in describing the interaction between initiators of a network and other involved actors with the aim of aligning their diverse interests in order to achieve a common goal. KODI comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders from government, private sector, inter-governmental organisation, and civil society. KODI has faced various challenges since its inception in 2011, some of which include lack of adequate resources, reduced support from some of the stakeholders, and a shift in government buy-in into the initiative. This caused the initiative to stall for a period of almost two years between the year 2012 and 2013, which suggests a disconnect in the interests of some of the key actors at the time. A description of the strategies applied by the network initiators to resuscitate the initiative is provided. This also includes a description of how the interests of the various actors were aligned to achieve a common cause. The study is explanatory, and results in a practical contribution describing the strategies that can help in securing buy-in of an open government data initiative.},

	abstract = {Objective To share approaches and innovations adopted to deliver a relatively inexpensive clinical data management (CDM) framework within a low-income setting that aims to deliver quality pediatric data useful for supporting research, strengthening the information culture and informing improvement efforts in local clinical practice.

Materials and methods The authors implemented a CDM framework to support a Clinical Information Network (CIN) using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a noncommercial software solution designed for rapid development and deployment of electronic data capture tools. It was used for collection of standardized data from case records of multiple hospitals’ pediatric wards. R, an open-source statistical language, was used for data quality enhancement, analysis, and report generation for the hospitals.

Results In the first year of CIN, the authors have developed innovative solutions to support the implementation of a secure, rapid pediatric data collection system spanning 14 hospital sites with stringent data quality checks. Data have been collated on over 37 000 admission episodes, with considerable improvement in clinical documentation of admissions observed. Using meta-programming techniques in R, coupled with branching logic, randomization, data lookup, and Application Programming Interface (API) features offered by REDCap, CDM tasks were configured and automated to ensure quality data was delivered for clinical improvement and research use.

Conclusion A low-cost clinically focused but geographically dispersed quality CDM (Clinical Data Management) in a long-term, multi-site, and real world context can be achieved and sustained and challenges can be overcome through thoughtful design and implementation of open-source tools for handling data and supporting research.},

	abstract = {To make good decisions about the future direction of cities we need data to contextualize and make recommendations that are based on past results and potential models for the future. Yet access to information including geographic information systems (GIS) is challenging, particularly as data are often seen as a commodity or source of power by those who control it, a dynamic more severe in contexts like Kenya. By generating GIS data for our own transportation model and then sharing them with those interested in doing research on Nairobi, we experienced firsthand some of the power dynamics associated with accessing and generating information in the developing country context. The project had several important lessons: (1) Simply developing data does not make them open; how “open access” is provided to the data is just as important as making them freely available. (2) Developing data can show commitment to a particular place or project that can help generate support for stronger partnerships and project goals. (3) Openly sharing data about place might help push those with access to information to share information as well. Overall this research project illustrated that sharing data can help support a more open access ecosystem locally by establishing a culture of data sharing but only if those interested in using it have the technical ability to both access and use data sets provided.},

	abstract = {Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) as important and unique collections that facilitate open access.

Design/methodology/approach
– The paper presents a brief introduction of the importance of ETD as materials for open access. This is with emphasis on the Kenya Information Preservation Society (KIPS) project which has, since 1993, been digitizing theses from a number of participating institutions across the country. This paper relies heavily on literature derived from existing documentation, online searches and website exploration, and the KIPS's union list of theses and dissertations CD‐ROM. A number of contracted employees (scanning and input) were also interviewed in order to provide statistics about the contributing institutions. Findings – The paper finds that the necessity of showcasing the intellectual research of higher education institutions within Kenya is reason enough to justify making the move towards creating electronic thesis services. The benefits making ETD available outweighs that of print‐only thesis provision due to the potential for enormous dissemination and open access. Research limitations/implications –ETD is a renowned research area for consideration. Librarians should be engaged in digitization of electronic collections that will provide desirable services to end users. Such approaches boost the knowledge economy of any country.

Practical implications
– Evidence cited from the strengths of KIPS indicates that its major objective was to compile a national comprehensive database of research on Kenya, and by Kenyans. From available statistics, theses undertaken at postgraduate university levels meet the needs of Kenyan scholars. Originality/value – This paper attempts to give insights for emulating the ETD initiative by KIPS as a way to showcase the unique materials of open access, thereby making them relevant for the modern day library.},

The research aimed to explore the extent to which these open data applications affect access to and use of government information in relation to service delivery within the sectors of Water, Health and Education. The research used a mixed method approach, which combined qualitative, quantitative and experimental methods. This was necessary to provide a holistic view of the status of open data awareness, access and use in the country and help us better understand the underlying factors that affect the roll out, adoption and use of open data. These methods included a literature review, a user perception survey, dashboard data analysis of the open data applications, in-depth interviews with key stakeholders and a user experience experiment on three open data platforms. Findings from these techniques were aggregated and cross-analyzed to measure the extent to which technology intermediaries have increased the accessibility and utilization of open data in Kenya.},

He knew that easier access to government data on topics ranging from demographics to education could help spur innovation in business and technology and help drive the country’s economic growth. The Official Secrets Act under former President Daniel arap Moi had long prevented civil servants from sharing government data, and for the most part, the trend had continued since the 2002 election of President Mwai Kibaki. But in 2011, Ndemo won Kibaki’s approval to create an Internet portal that would serve as a one-stop shop for government census, economic, health and education data. With Kibaki’s support, Ndemo persuaded other ministries to allow access to the data, and he assembled a volunteer task force of computer programmers, data experts and ministry and World Bank officials to build the website and upload information. After the site—opendata.go.ke­—went online in July 2011, the ministry started taking crucial steps to ensure the system’s effectiveness by training journalists in how to use the data in their reporting, by encouraging software developers to build applications that manipulated the data to explore trends, and by working to streamline the continuing flow of information to the site from government institutions. The case highlights Ndemo’s efforts to open Kenya’s government to the country’s citizens and the world.},

Webometric approaches and interviews with IR managers were used to collect the data for the study. The findings showed that Kenya has made some progress in adopting OA with a total of 12 IRs currently listed in the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) and five mandatory self-archiving policies listed in the Registry of Open Access Repositories Mandatory Archiving Policies (ROARMAP). Most of the IRs are owned by universities where theses and dissertations constitute the majority of the content type followed by journal articles. The results on the usage and impact of materials deposited in Kenyan IRs indicated that the most viewed publications in the repositories also received citations in Google Scholar, thereby signifying their impact and importance. The results also showed that there was a considerable interest in Swahili language publications among users of the repositories in Kenya.},

Clinical trials data management (CTDM) remains one of the many challenges in running state of the art trials in resource-poor settings since most trials do not allocate, or have available, sufficient resources for CTDM and because of poor internet connectivity. Open-source software like OpenClinica could be a solution in such scenarios.

Findings
In 2007, the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP) adopted OpenClinica (OC) community edition, an open-source software system and we share our experience and lessons learnt since its adoption. We have used OC in three different modes; direct remote data entry from sites through Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) modems, a centralized data centre approach where all data from paper records were entered at a central location and an off-line approach where data entry was done from a copy of database hosted on a field-site server laptop, then data uploaded to a centralized server later. We have used OC in eleven trials/studies with a cumulative number of participants in excess of 6000. These include large and complex trials, with multiple sites recruiting in different regions of East Africa. In the process, we have developed substantial local capacity through hands-on training and mentorship, which we have now begun to share with other institutions in the region.

Conclusions
Our experience demonstrates that an open source data management system to manage trials’ data can be utilized to international industry standards in resource-poor countries.},

The Uganda/Kenya case study investigated Impact of Open Data on resource allocation for poverty eradication in Uganda and Kenya. This case study was premised on the experiences of countries that have been involved in Open Data since the beginning. Open data has its roots in the Open Government Partnership founded in 2009 and launched in 2011, initially with a membership of eight countries but which has since grown to 63 (In East Africa, Kenya and Tanzania are members but Uganda has not yet signed up despite increasing calls to do so). Its aim is providing an international platform for domestic reformers committed to making their governments more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens. There has been increasing enthusiasm by governments since then to publish data online. Many members have since established national data webportals and made avail huge amounts of data that were previously not in the public domain. The impact of this on resource allocation and the broader transparency agenda has been significant. It has created more upward information flow, local, national and international pressures and bottom-up citizen and political pressures on governments to be more open.},

However, most governments have not realised the desired value streams or outcomes from OGD. The Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI), a Government of Kenya initiative, is no exception with some moments of success but also sustainability struggles. Therefore, the focus for this paper is to understand the causal mechanisms that either enable or constrain institutionalisation of OGD initiatives. Critical realism is ideally suited as a paradigm to identify such mechanisms, but guides to its operationalisation are few. This study uses the operational approach of Bygstad, Munkvold \& Volkoff's six-step framework, a hybrid approach that melds concepts from existing critical realism models with the idea of affordances. The findings suggest that data demand and supply mechanisms are critical in institutionalising KODI and that, underpinning basic data-related affordances, are mechanisms engaging with institutional capacity, formal policy, and political support. It is the absence of such elements in the Kenya case which explains why it has experienced significant delays.},

Open access (OA) publishing, in which journals provide online access to articles free of charge, breaks this barrier and allows unrestricted access to scientific and scholarly information to researchers all over the globe. At the same time, one major limitation to OA is a high publishing cost that is placed on authors. Following recent developments to OA publishing policies in the UK and even LMICs, this article highlights the current status and future challenges of OA in Africa. We place particular emphasis on Kenya, where multidisciplinary efforts to improve access have been established. We note that these efforts in Kenya can be further strengthened and potentially replicated in other African countries, with the goal of elevating the visibility of African research and improving access for African researchers to global research, and, ultimately, bring social and economic benefits to the region. We (1) offer recommendations for overcoming the challenges of implementing OA in Africa and (2) call for urgent action by African governments to follow the suit of high-income countries like the UK and Australia, mandating OA for publicly-funded research in their region and supporting future research into how OA might bring social and economic benefits to Africa.},

	abstract = {Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to review the use of open access (OA) resources in Kenyan university libraries with the gist of the discussions being the status of the universities in the implementation of OA, usefulness, challenges and recommendations.

Design/methodology/approach
– The study employed descriptive research by engaging respondents in formal interviews and brief discussions. It also reviewed existing related literature on OA resources with specific reference to four university libraries in Kenya.

Findings
– Kenya as a developing country is still at the intermediate stage of embracing OA. The university libraries are among the forefront institutions helping in the adoption of OA for research, empowerment, education and information. However, compared to other universities in Africa, Kenyan universities are far many steps ahead in embracing OA.

Research limitations/implications
– The study limited itself to descriptive survey supported by face to face interviews, informal discussions and literature. This may not give 100 percentage accurate results for the study. However, the triangulation of the instruments were sufficient enough to have credible study findings.

Practical implications
– OA to information is not a simple technological issue. It raises issues of information policies, such as availability, reliability, infrastructure, technical knowledge, legal barriers and production/creation. As the Kenyan Government enhances its efforts in going digital, universities and especially the libraries have become key stakeholders in the arranging and availing of this information through OA. It is therefore important to review the gains made and the challenges encountered by Kenyan university libraries in as far as OA is concerned.

Originality/value
– This paper discusses OA status in university libraries in Kenya, which is a new development in the information cycles in Africa.},

	abstract = {This paper is based on the findings of a study that evaluated the initiatives taken by East African countries to embrace the open access movement. Specifically, the study analysed the position of East African countries in disseminating open access literature in Africa and globally; determined the contribution of each East African country to global open access literature; identified the type of document as well as Open source software they used. Moreover, the study analysed the subject content of OARs and identified the language for the archived items. The study first used literature review to determine current status of open access in East Africa, then the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) were accessed to get the required data. The results revealed that East African counties make only a miniscule contribution to Open Access literature of about 0.022 percent of items found in global OARs and 1.2 percent by number of repositories. The study concluded that East African countries with a slight exception of Kenya lag far behind in open access literature. The study, therefore, recommends more efforts to be made by individual East African countries to make necessary arrangements required to adopt and use OA repositories to enhance free access to knowledge and information and, consequently, boost socioeconomic development in the region.},

In this paper we report on the Kenya study, run at four universities that have been selected with randomly sampled students and lecturers. Empirical data have been generated by the use of a student and a lecturer questionnaire to which in total 798 students and 43 lecturers have responded. Selected from the very rich source two major outcomes are: (i) there is a significant digital differentiation among lecturers and students at urban versus rural universities in terms of their proficiency and internet accessibility; and (ii) the awareness and appreciation of the OER concept and open licensing is low but from the actual processing by respondents of educational resources (not necessarily open) a ‘preparedness for openness’ can be derived that promises well for the future.},

	abstract = {In this age of information explosion no library is able to satisfy all the needs of its users due to various constraints. It is because of this phenomenon that the concept of library IMS has developed. To achieve this, those who are responsible for the libraries should take into account their active and passive users. Furthermore, not only the academicians who make use of the libraries but also those who do not make use of them should be considered. It is against this background that this study main purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of opens source Integrated Management Information Systems (MIS) in Libraries, Strathmore University as a case. The objectives of the study were: to determine the effectiveness of open source integrated information management system in use at Strathmore university library, to find out the users’ attitudes towards the integrated management information system at Strathmore University Library’, to find out the challenges facing the integrated management systems in Strathmore university and suggest recommendations that would help in improving the use of Koha at Strathmore University Library. The study utilized a case study and was carried out within Strathmore University. The study found out that the integration of information management system in the provision of library service is to a great degree perceived to be effective. However, there was need for improvement. The findings further revealed that, most members of staff and students have positive attitudes towards the use of Koha at the Strathmore University library. This implies that they would appreciate being trained to use it and support any efforts to improve the system. The study concluded that there were still enormous challenges in integration of the management information system in Libraries due some reasons for instance the constant change of software, internet failure and the lack of technology know how among some clients. The study recommended that there is need for continuous training to students and staff to keep then abreast of the technological changes of integrated information systems and innovative strategies of dealing with the challenges associated with Koha.},

Today, an increasing number of institutions and individuals share digital resources via the Internet free of any legal, financial or technical barriers. As such, open educational resources may be part of a solution to this problem. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between students’ perceptions and utilization of open educational resources for academic work in private universities in Kenya. The study used the correlational research design. The study targeted 5,375 undergraduate part time students. While the accessible population was 2716 bachelor of Education part time students drawn from five private universities purposively chosen. Proportionate sampling was used to determine the subjects from each university. Simple random sampling was used to select respondents from the 3rd and 4th years. Data was collected using students’ questionnaire and focus group discussion groups. There was also a positive relationship between utilization of open educational resources and students’ perceptions on open educational resources and therefore the relationship is significant (r (321) = 0.394; p {\textless}0.05). This means that the more students have positive perceptions on the open educational resources the more they will use open educational resources for academic work. Descriptive statistics (percentages and frequencies) were used to analyze quantitative data while Regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Exchange of information within the Government is usually through formal 
communication such as official letters, gazette notices , internal memos, circulars, 
print media and also through minutes . This has not been very effective, due to lack of 
seamless exchange of information among Government Ministries since they work 
independently. The main cause being lack of an interoperable platform in terms of 
software which would help ease exchange of information. As a result of this, a lot of 
inefficiencies in service delivery to the citizenry have been experienced. This has 
been confirmed through ratings in performance contracting of various sectors in 
government over the years. 
In order to achieve software interoperability framework within the Government, 
quantitative research method was used in collaboration with other research methods 
such as descriptive research. The research was carried out within the National 
Government to ascertain various issues that relate to software interoperability with a 
view of developing a standard framework that will act as a guideline within the 
National Government. Through the research , it was possible to justify how lack of 
this important guideline within government has led to denial of associated benefits 
to the citizenry. Since there is no universal standardized software interoperability 
framework that any Government could directly adopt without customization, it was 
important to develop a software interoperability framework that is based on known 
user requirements within the Government of Kenya hence the need for a Software 
Interoperability Framework. 
The main objective of the research being to develop software interoperability 
framework between open source and proprietary software, this was accomplished by 
enhancing an existing software interoperability conceptual model by ATHENA 
consortium. The framework has further been improved by introducing various 
parameters and components that have a direct effect on the framework due to their 
interrelation nature hence making the framework more comprehensive.},

Given the advantages of using Open Source Software in university operations, there is need for better understanding of the key challenges facing usage and implementation of Open Source Systems and therefore propose a framework for implementation of open source systems. The study focuses to determine the key challenges facing the usage and implementation of open source software for teaching, learning and management activities of private universities in Kenya and proposes a framework for implementing open source systems in Kenyan universities. The study adopted descriptive survey design. 
The findings from this research provides evidence that most universities need to provide for adequate budget to go towards supporting the systems use the main conclusions drawn from this study are that private chartered universities in Kenya have implemented Open Source Software. This is perhaps the reason why many private chartered 
universities have automated most university processes, and that Moodle Open Source Software is widely used.},

	abstract = {Open Access Journals (OAJs) and Institutional Repositories (IRs) are Open
Access (OA) outlets that provide a platform for disseminating research
findings. Although these outlets have been introduced in universities to
increase dissemination, access and impact of staff, academic staff adoption of
such outlets in Africa has been slow and their use of these outlets in
disseminating their research works has been low. This study sought to establish
the challenges academic staff face with regard to OA outlets. It established
outlets employed by academic staff in dissemination, their awareness, skills
and training, attitude and use of OA outlets. Rogers Diffusion of Innovations
theory was used. Descriptive design using survey method was used for this
study. The target population was 15,000 academic staff from which a sample
of 381 was selected using stratified sampling technique. The study was
conducted in 12 private and 7 public universities in Kenya. Questionnaires
were used to collect data. A pilot study to assure validity and reliability was
conducted, yielding a Cronbach correlation coefficient of 0.76 which was
considered acceptable. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used
to generate data. Descriptive statistics such as percentages and means were
used for analysis. The study established that academics preferred traditional
publishing outlets for dissemination but they were associated with problems of
accessibility, cost and delays in publishing while OA outlets were associated
with low quality. General awareness of OAP among academic staff was high
(66\%) but awareness of specific OA aspects was low. A majority of academic
staff were active consumers of OAJs (74.3\%) and IR content (75.7\%) but not
prolific contributors at 20.9\% and 27.5\% respectively. Only 29\% of the
academic staff had training in OAJs and IRs. The study concluded that
traditional publishing outlets were utilized more than OA outlets and
awareness of OAP was low among scholars. The study recommends awareness
creation of OA outlets, capacity building in self archiving, institutionalization
of OA outlets in Kenyan universities and enhancement of academic - library
staff collaborations, among others. The study findings are significant to all
stakeholders interested in dissemination of research findings through OA
outlets.},

This study also explored the challenges encountered in the adoption of open source software, as an alternate to the proprietary software, in computing.
The study focused on all the 43 commercial banks in Kenya. The banking sector was selected largely because it has always taken a lead role in implementing strategic management practices and is reported to spend huge amounts on the same. The respondents were IT Managers in the 43 commercial banks.
The questionnaires were used to collect information from the information technology
department and other employees concerned with information technology adoption and implementation. The basis of using descriptive measure was to give a basis for determining the weights of the variables under the study. The findings were then presented using tables, pie charts, and bar graphs for easier interpretation. The analysis and data collected the following discussions, conclusions and recommendations were made.
The study revealed that the majority of respondents were males. Majority of these respondents were in their positions for about 5 years, had a degree and were of age 30 years and below which was a clear indication that they were young. On the extent of use of OSS in the commercial banks, the survey findings indicate that majority of the banks were partially using open source on their desktop computers and planned to increase the OSS share by adopting to replace some components. The OSS applications that were mostly being used were Linux and Mozilla.
The survey findings indicate that OSS in commercial banks in Kenya is widely being used and there are various challenges being faced in the adoption. These challenges include a need for an analysis of a return on investment on using OSS, high switching costs when migrating from proprietary software to OSS and uncertainty on the availability of support services.},

	abstract = {Latest technological advancements in computer storage, networking and processor speeds
have enabled organizations to develop innovative ways to intelligently collect data that was
not possible before. However, this has led to the explosion of data and unprecedented
challenges in making strategic and effective use of the available data. The current
information systems such as executive information systems and decision support systems,
among others, have not been able to provide crucial reports to decision makers. Decision
makers require reports that are timely, accurate, actionable, and depicting the whole
„business picture‟. Business Intelligent (BI) systems come to the rescue of decision makers.
BI systems provide timely, accurate, and actionable information to the right person
enabling quick and correct decisions. Higher learning institutions like universities, being
one of the organizations, require such systems for effective management. Past studies
reveal little adoption of BI in Kenyan Universities. This research project was geared
towards implementing a Business Intelligence System for Kenyan Universities; taking a
case of the Technical University of Kenya. Kimball‟s dimension modeling was used in
designing a data warehouse. The system was implemented using Hadoop cluster integrated
with R Statistical Software. Data warehouse was developed and analysis achieved using
Hive Query Language and R through data visualization and dashboards. Comparison with
the state-of-art open source BI tools was conducted. The project revealed great
opportunities for open source tools in data analytics for universities. The study
recommended a real-time BI system that would relay live status of events for effective
decision-making and also incorporation of unstructured data from social media in
improving the University analytics.},

application requirements. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adoption of
open source software in the telecommunications industry in Kenya, establish the
benefits that have been realized through adoption of OSS, determine the challenges
faced by the adoption of OSS as well as establish if telecommunication companies
plan to begin the use of open source in the future. The study was done in the four
telecommunications service providers in Kenya namely Safaricom, Airtel Kenya,
Orange Telkom and Equitel. The conclusion of the study is that there is significant
adoption of open source software by telecommunication companies in Kenya with
leading benefits of adoption being cost efficiency, increased software flexibility and
avoiding vendor lock-in. The above benefits notwithstanding, there are challenges that
are associated with the adoption as well and this include lack of proper software
support, switching costs from proprietary software and quality of open source
software which cannot be relied upon to run mission critical telecommunication
services. However, with the rapidly evolving technology and changing consumer
patterns that necessitates technological advancements and innovations, open source
therefore offers a solution for the companies in the telecommunications industry to

As a result, immediate steps must be taken to share the research output for development. A major recent innovation in research sharing within the domain of libraries is institutional repositories. In 2011, cumulatively of over 65\% of libraries in Kenya had embraced or were in the process of establishing digital repositories in their institutions while 35\% had not. This study aimed at establishing the current status of institutional repositories in Kenya.This study used Diffusion of innovation Theory (DOI) to develop a theoretical framework to guide the study and mixed method design to collect and analyze data from sample of 111 Institutional repository administrators purposively sampled. SoGoSurvey, an online platform was used to collect and analyze the results real-time as received from respondents. It also presented the analyzed data in tables, totals, percentages, charts and graphs. The findings revealed that the Kenyan Government had a stake for the successes of the implementation of digital institutional repositories since majority of libraries in KLISC were government institutions. The findings also showed that digital repositories were managed by librarians in different library departments and not necessarily digital repository librarians. The high rate of repository managers with other designations was also a clear sign that repository management had not acquired a fully recognized professional status in Kenya. In addition, the results indicated that although majority of KLISC member libraries had established or were in the process of establishing institutional repositories, there were still a sizable number of libraries that are yet to develop institutional repositories.Key Words: Institutional Repositories, Libraries, Consortium},

This is more critical to postgraduate students, who are required to read much more on their own and prepare for their research and thesis undertakings. Looking at universities in the third world countries, there are challenges of access to current and relevant literature. This is due to lack of modern library facilities as well as high costs of accessing the available ones. The uptake of modern technology in learning and teaching including e-learning and Open Educational Resources are still out of reach by many learners and lecturers alike. Distance learners are also faced with time constraints as they work, and many of them are very far from any access to literature. This study aimed at determining the level of access to literature and related challenges including attitude, among postgraduate students who are in the open and distance learning (ODL) mode at Egerton University. The study revealed the gaps existing in access to literature and their effects on the quality of learning and research outputs of these learners.

	abstract = {This study explores Open Data actors in Kenya, focusing on the issue of transparency and accountability. Drawing on an exploratory quantitative analysis of existing statistical material of usage of the Kenya Open Data Initiative website and 15 qualitative interviews conducted primarily in Nairobi, the study analyses key factors – both enabling and disabling – that shape transparency initiatives connected to Open Data in Kenya.  
The material is analysed from three perspectives:  
a) a review based on existing research around impact and effectiveness of transparency and accountability initiatives;  
b) based on theories on human behaviour in connection to transparency and accountability; and  
c) introducing a critical perspective on power relations based on Michel Foucault’s concept of ‘governmentality’.  
The study shows that the Kenya Open Data Initiative has potential to become an effective transparency and accountability initiative in Kenya, but that its future is heavily dependent on current trends within the political context and fluctuations in power relations. Applying a stronger user-perspective and participatory approach is critical. 
Open Data is a relatively new area within the governance and development field, and academia can play an important role in enhancing methodology and impact assessments to create more effective and sustainable initiatives and ensure that future Open Data initiatives can be both accessible and constitute a base for accountability.},

	title = {Creating impacts with open data for agriculture and nutrition in {Kenya}},
	url = {http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/534208},
	abstract = {Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. It is widely recognised as a priority goal by
the development community and a driver for economic growth. Open data has the potential to
contribute to one of the sustainable development goals: ending hunger. Recent high level interest has
drawn special attention to the importance of open data in light of growing and critical global challenges affecting the health and welfare of people everywhere, including: the G8 Open Data Charter in 2013, the World Bank in 2014 and the GODAN Summit in New York in 2016. The June 2017 Ministerial Conference on Open data for Agriculture and Nutrition hosted by the Kenyan Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries culminated in the Nairobi declaration in which 15 African countries commit themselves to strengthen the role of open data for their agricultural development.
The Government of Kenya is actively pursuing an open data policy in the field of agriculture and nutrition and has its own open data portal that features hundreds of data sets on agriculture and nutrition. There are also many other data collections that are of great value. With all these data sources available on the supply side, there is scope to deploy them for creating impacts in agriculture and nutrition, specifically with respect to food security. However, steps of enrichment of data to information and knowledge need to be taken, just as understanding the (user) needs or the beneficiaries that could work with the data.
This project scoped the supply (i.e. available datasets) and demand (requirements of end users) of (open) data for agriculture and nutrition in the Kenyan context and developed showcases and a prototype, that focused on potential impacts of use of data in agriculture and nutrition in Kenya. The
showcases and prototype are transferable to other African countries:
1. Support to student led agricultural extension (led by University of Nairobi)
2. Using open data to support evidence-based policy making (led by WEnR)
3. Supporting start-ups (led by CTA)
4. Joint actions across the value chain for people, planet and profit (led by CABI). This
showcase is the basis for the prototype (co-developed by WEnR and CABI).
During a reflection workshop in Nairobi with over 25 representatives from Kenyan government, -business and -research, feedback was gathered to test whether the problem was correctly identified, if the right (open) data was used, if the proposed solution was workable and whether the solution had an obvious business model with stakeholders.
Main findings include:
● collaboration among value chain players through open data will optimize the supply chain with
shared benefits
● business involvement is crucial to guarantee continuity of a solution and must be present from
the onset.
● User driven co-development is necessary to identify required data, share local data and open
local data since not all the required data is openly available, or easily accessible.
● prototyping is a useful mechanism to match supply with demand. We recommend co-development of a prototype to bring open data closer to a fully functioning application via a standardised method. The prototype could focus on the middle-tier of identifying and obtaining the right inputs and strengthen the position of and trust between farmers, agri-dealers and
traders.},

	abstract = {Literature has revealed that open access journals and institutional repositories provide an 
outlet used for dissemination of scholarly research. Although the introduction of these 
outlets in universities has led to increased access and dissemination of research findings, 
the usage of these outlets is yet to be realized. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
adoption of open access initiatives in dissemination of research findings by academic 
staff in selected universities in Kenya. The objectives of this study were; to establish the 
types of outlets accessed by academic staff, find out the extent to which academic staff 
were aware of open access, to determine the level of usage of OA outlets by academic 
staff in accessing and disseminating their research work and to find out the attitude of 
academic staff towards open access initiatives. The study utilized the theory of 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Descriptive research design was used for this 
study. In total 301 academic staff from both University of Nairobi and Africa Nazarene 
University were selected using simple random sampling methods. Stratified sampling 
was used to stratify the academic staff according to their academic status and simple 
random sampling was used to get samples from each of the strata. Questionnaires, 
document and desk review were used to collect data and information. A Pilot study was 
conducted at Catholic University of Eastern Africa to assure validity and reliability. 
Analysis of data was through Microsoft excel and Statistical Package for Social Sciences 
(SPSS) and was presented in form of tables of frequencies and percentages, and charts. 
Descriptive statistics such as percentages and means were used for analysis. Findings 
from this study revealed that the attitude of academic staff towards OA was positive 
signifying acceptance of this mode of scholarly communication. However, traditional 
outlets were still the preferred mode of scholarly communication by academic staff and 
that open access publishing was low. The study recommends institutionalization of open 
access publishing in Universities in Kenya and training on open access issues to improve 
access and dissemination of scholarly research. This research will be useful to academic 
institutions, education and policy administrators and libraries in Kenya so as to improve 
the usage of open access outlets among academic staff.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of adoption of institutional repositories in dissemination of scholarly information in universities in Kenya with reference to United States International University Africa. Objectives of the study were to: find out factors that influence the adoption of institutional repository at the university, examine the perceptions of users concerning the adoption of institutional repository at the university, assess the extent to which the university management supports the adoption of institutional repository at the university, establish the degree of awareness of availability of institutional repository at the university, determine the strategies applied by the university in relation to use of institutional repository at the university. The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods. Stratified random sampling was used to collect data from postgraduate students and academic staff. Purposive sampling was used to collect data from the library staff. The study used structured questionnaires and interview schedule to collect data from 150 graduate students, 25 academic staff and 25 library staff. The study used content analysis to analyze qualitative data for the study. Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to analyze quantitative data collected and represented the same into percentages, pie charts, graphs and tables for better interpretation. Findings from this study revealed that although institutional repositories are very significant in addressing challenges users face in relation to access and use of repository resources, the library staff lacks the necessary skills to manage the repository effectively; findings also revealed that the management has not put up policies with regards to access and use of the repository resources. The study recommends that the library management needs to organize training for the staff to manage the repository effectively; in addition, the library management should come up with policy guidelines to guide users on access and use of the repository resources.},

	abstract = {Purpose
– Despite its fast growth and penetration in all sectors, it has been noted that open source software (OSS) is yet to find its optimal place in libraries, particularly libraries in the developing countries. Lack of documented information on the experiences and use of open source integrated library system (ILS) is a major drawback, and so the need for this study. The proposed study aims to help to investigate and test usability and cost effectiveness of a typical OSS for ILS. It will involve deploying the software from installation, configuration to creating customized user interfaces and structures that are specific to the requirements of the library's parent organization. The cost and performance of the OSS will then be compared with that of a typical commercial based software with the same functionalities.

Design/methodology/approach
– A preliminary study has been conducted to collect data from libraries in the country through distribution of questionnaires to provide data for accurate analysis that will form the basis for recommendations. The target group includes library and IT personnel in the various institutions and the end-users within sample group. A case study is proposed to help establish OSS effectiveness in libraries. To test a typical OSS, parameters are to be drawn from two models – open source maturity model and business readiness rating.

Findings
– A casual observation of the Kenyan situation reveals that the majority of academic, public and research libraries depend on commercial, free or locally developed systems. This scenario may be attributed to lack of knowledge (or interest) in OSS alternatives and lack of sufficient technical expertise to support them. While there are quite a number of libraries and librarians worldwide that have shown a great interest in OSS, few library administrators have actually implemented OSS. Could this be due to fear of taking on the risks that may come with reliance on open source library automation systems? Is the low uptake due to lack of sufficient technical expertise in the libraries? The research outcomes will help formulate a model and guidelines to be used by systems librarians considering the use of OSS for library processes. Factors to be considered when deciding on OSS will be outlined.

Research limitations/implications
– This paper is of importance to library personnel in Kenya as it establishes the effectiveness of OSS, with the aim of empowering the library staff who have for a long time relied on their IT departments and vendors for systems installation and implementation.

Originality/value
– The study will result in a comprehensive evaluation of the economic and functional advantages of OSS as an alternative for the library in Kenya. Librarians involved in selection of software for their libraries will find this helpful when deciding on the type of software to select for their libraries. It will help to enlighten library professional about the value of OSS and how they can participate in the development of their own systems, instead of always relying on vendors.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to synthesize emerging themes from the findings of three studies carried out in Kenya and Uganda in a research project dubbed the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing Countries1 (ODDC). The paper presents reviews of the emerging themes, highlights possible opportunities and challenges for building sustainable infrastructure for open data and effective citizen engagement strategies, and finally draws conclusions for possible policy debates and policy formulation. In so doing, the paper will help to highlight the emerging landscape of Open Data in Kenya and Uganda particularly with the focus on the infrastructure of data communities of civic engagement, their incentives and how this conceptions influence open data movements.
This paper is organized around the following research questions: Does the application of open data by public institutions in, say, education and health affect their service provision to the public? What incentives drive public institutions to embrace open data: is it the need to improve service provision, or the skills and knowledge available in the public sector, the political leadership, the change in public administration policies supporting open data or available information technology? And will the desire by government officials to have real time interactions with the citizens be motivating enough for public agencies to invest in essential competencies that enable openness in government data? How about the push from other communities that are organized around the ideologies of transparency, accountability, equity, relevance and responsiveness to community needs, and effectiveness and efficiency of governance systems and processes? Does this influence the conception and implementation of open data (Gregg Brown 2010)? Lastly, how do the access to enabling information
technologies supporting new frontiers for open data?},

	abstract = {The Internet has been celebrated for its ability to erode barriers between nations. Social media is a powerful medium that can unite, inform, and move people. One post can start a chain of events that changes the world. It gives users fast access to and sharing of information and facilitates ease of communication. However, the Internet allows for a lot of negativity as well. There has been an increase in hate speech activities on social media in the Kenyan cyber space.  
The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) was established to facilitate and promote equality of opportunity, good relations, harmony and peaceful co-existence between persons of the different ethnic and racial communities of Kenya, and to advise the Government on all aspects thereof (Act No, 12, 2008). In particular, the NCIC Act of 2008 is mandated to curb hate speech.  
This research studied existing hate speech detection tools in use by NCIC, then identified gaps and challenges faced. A technical solution (tool for analyzing hate speech) was proposed that can be implemented by the NCIC and the government to respond to hate-speech cases perpetrated through social media platforms. The developed tool tracked challenges and gaps in the existing tools currently in use by NCIC for hate speech monitoring, detection and analysis. Due to the differences in Application Programming Interface (API) implementation on the variety of social media platforms used in Kenya, the scope of this research is limited to Twitter.  
This research employed the use of predictive analytics for text classification using Naïve Bayes. A tool that uses the predictive model in assistance to detection of hate-speech online was developed to conceptualize the solutions discussed in this research.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Access to information and knowledge is the fundamental right of every human, but this is not always achieved without limitations. Today, an increasing number of institutions and individuals share digital resources via the Internet free of any legal, financial or technical barriers. The high demand for university education in Kenya has put more pressure on the existing learning resources such as print resources, whose cost partly makes education more expensive among other factors. As such, open educational resources may be part of a solution to this problem. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between students’ awareness and utilization of open educational resources for academic work in private universities in Kenya Correlational research design was used and the target population of the study was 5,375 undergraduate part time students. Purposive sampling was used to select participating private universities since not all of them offer Bachelor of Education part time programme, while proportionate sampling was used to determine the respondents from each university. Simple random sampling was used to select respondents from the 3rd and 4th years. Data was collected using students’ questionnaire. Reliability coefficient was estimated using the Cronbach alpha. A reliability coefficient of 0.77 was found acceptable for this study since it was way above the 0.7 alpha coefficient set as adequate. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse quantitative data while regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The study revealed that there is a positive relationship between utilization and awareness index and therefore the relationship is significant (r (321) = 0.373; p {\textless}0.05). The researcher concluded that the students need to be sensitized more on OERs so that their awareness is increased and thereby increasing OERs utilization.},

This has been necessitated by the rising cost of print information resources coupled with the dwindling library budgets. In addition, space utilization has been affected due to the storage of student projects within the libraries. The purpose of the study was to determine the uptake of open access initiatives and incentives undertaken in middle level college libraries in Kenya with the view to improve delivery of information services in libraries. The study sought to establish the initiatives and incentives used to implement and sustain open access in middle level college libraries with special reference to the Kenya Institute of Management Library Network. It established the methods used to promote open access initiatives in middle level college libraries. Objectives of the study were: explore the components that determine quality and quantity of research publications, assess the impact of Open Access incentives in improving delivery of library services in an academic library, investigate ICT infrastructure and components necessary for the implementation of open access and explore the use of information literacy as a model for sensitization of open access at the Kenya Institute of Management. Nature of the study was based on a case study approach where both qualitative and quantitative were used. It targeted a total population of 155 respondents that included Librarians, senior library assistants, library assistants, school of management staff and lectures. The sample of the study was 110 respondents who were sampled through purposive sampling method. Data collection methods included use of survey questionnaires, telephone interviews. Qualitative and quantitative data was analyzed and involved the application of tables and pie chart. The study found out that middle level libraries could improve the quality and quantity of research by use of policies, availing local content research as an incentive for publishing in open access, implementation of an institutional repository, application of various ICT components such as good intranet and networking system, use of webometrics in raising the impact factor of research. Thus, the study proposed several recommendations which included; more research should be conducted on open access in middle level colleges’ more advocation of open access should be provided through information literacy, the library should initiate publishing of research in open access institutional repository and to establish a publishing department.},

	url = {https://www.oerknowledgecloud.org/record241},
	abstract = {This thesis examines how and under what conditions Open Educational Resources (OER) can improve the dissemination of knowledge in Sub Saharan Africa. According to UNESCO’s definition, OER are digitised materials offered freely and openly for educators, students and self-learners to use and reuse for teaching, learning and research educational materials2 . The OER movement has mainly been led from the West, by large institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Thus, there is a danger that Africans will be consigned to the role of consumers of OER instead of producers. Nonetheless, OER offer great potentials for Africa if implemented appropriately. There is little literature on OER dealing specifically with Sub Sahara Africa, and the handful of articles that have been published on this topic take a narrow educational approach and avoid wider socio-economic and socio-political questions. Hence, this research examines not only how OER can be used as a cost-effective tool to improve the quality of education, but also how it might alleviate or worsen problems inhibiting knowledge dissemination such as information imperialism, brain drain, lack of access to education and knowledge to disadvantaged groups, intolerance to independent debate and civil conflict. In order to find some preliminary answers to these questions, additional data were gathered by conducting over twenty interviews with experts on OER in general or on ICT, education and development in Sub Saharan Africa. The bottom line is that OER can help in dealing with some of the problems inhibiting the effective dissemination of knowledge in Sub Saharan Africa. However, only creating the necessary technological infrastructure in order to deliver OER will not be enough. The concept of OER can only work if Africans become more involved in the creation and adaptation OER according to their specific needs. Institutional, nation African wide and international policy frameworks should be put in place to enable this to happen. In order to establish such a policyframework, African champions are needed on all levels to engage in awareness raising and capacity building around the concept of OER and to start up pilot projects. Moreover, OER networks should be developed which can not only affect change on the policy level, but also on the lives of African people.},

	abstract = {The Open Science (OS) movement promises nothing less than a revolution in the availability of scientific knowledge around the globe. By removing barriers to online data and encouraging publication in Open Access formats and Open Data archives, OS seeks to expand the role, reach and value of research. The promises of OS imply a set of expectations about what different publics hope to gain from research, how accountability and participation can be enhanced, and what makes science public in the first place. This paper presents empirical material from fieldwork undertaken in (bio)chemistry laboratories in Kenya and South Africa to examine the extent to which these ideals can be realized in a sub-Saharan context. To analyse the challenges African researchers face in making use of freely available data, we draw from Amartya Sen’s Capabilities Approach. His theorisations of ‘conversion factors’ helps to understand how seemingly minor economic and social contingencies can hamper the production and (re-)use of online data. In contrast to initiatives that seek to make more data available, we suggest the need to facilitate a more egalitarian engagement with online data resources.},

In view of the low purchasing power in developing countries, open access (OA) publishing avails needed reading material for all who have access to the Internet. Foreign sponsored research in developing countries can uplift the living standards of the people in these regions if the results of the findings can influence policy and are made available to the people studied. This study sought to establish if research findings of foreign sponsored research are published in OA publications. The study conducted a survey on leading local medical research institutions in Kenya using secondary data and interviews with key informants in these institutions. The results failed to support the hypothesis that foreign sponsored researchers are published in prescribed journals as a prerequisite by the sponsors. Instead, they indicated that local researchers published in international subscription journals because of their desire for prestige and wide reach. Consequently, the North-South knowledge inequality is perpetuated more by the local elite, whose desire for international recognition overrides social benefits, thereby supporting the hypothesis that foreign funded research on mutual aid in Kenya results in more private than social benefits. There is a need for the local learned society to embrace a paradigm shift towards building reputable local journals and accepting the OA concept.},

	abstract = {Open source products such as software development tools and server applications are gaining popularity among expert users. There is however a notable lag in adoption of desktop open source software among ordinary users especially in Africa. A number of critical factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions have been suggested as the determinants of Information and Communication Technologies adoption in general. This study deemed it important to establish if the above factors are the determinants of desktop open source software adoption in Africa. 
The study aimed to establish the Open Source Software adoption levels among university students in Kenya as well as the factors affecting Open Source Software adoption in this population. The author further aimed to assess the applicability of popular technology acceptance models in the adoption of the software in the population under study. The study employed literature review, quantitative and qualitative approaches. The study also used both descriptive and explanatory research designs in answering the research questions. The Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology was used as a theoretical framework because it has synthesised all its major predecessors and accommodated all the predecessors constructs. The other reason The Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology was used is because the model was developed specifically for predicting voluntary technology adoption. 
This study established that the adoption of Free Open Source Software products in Kenya is very low and existing literature revealed that this is also the case in other developing countries. The study concluded that the factors affecting adoption of desktop Open Source Software by Kenyan university students are usability, user training, Open Source Software compatibility, social influence, prior experience, social economic status, job market demands, proprietary software piracy culture and patent and copyright laws. 
Hence the study suggested that the existing technology adoption models are not appropriate in predicting technology adoption in an Africa setup. The study proposed and validated an appropriate model that fits in this context.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the status of Africa in the open access environment as well as the challenges of providing global visibility to African research outputs. A descriptive bibliometric approach was adopted for the study. Data was extracted from two world repository directories (Registry of Open Access Repositories - ROAR and Directory of Open Access Repositories - DOAR) and Directory of Open Access Journals – DOAJ to determine the presence of Africa and size of repositories and records found in the directories. Findings reveal that only 20 African countries have presence in ROAR and DOAJ, but 22 countries have presence in DOAR. South Africa has more repositories in ROAR and DOAR while Egypt has over 70\% of African contributions to DOAJ. The subject coverage of the repositories indicates that there are more publications in the sciences than there are in the social sciences and humanities; the preferred languages of publication in the directories are English, German and French. Though there is slow adoption of publishing in open access journals in Africa, there has been an increase in the number of open access journal articles from 2,019 in 2005 to 24,997 in 2014. The paper calls on African governments, researchers and librarians to deploy sustainable mechanisms to increase global visibility of African research findings using open access platforms.},

In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is an increase in trypanosome non-susceptibility to multiple trypanocides, but limited information on judicious trypanocide use is accessible to smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders in disease endemic regions, resulting in widespread multi-drug resistance. Huge economic expenses and the laborious nature of extensive field studies have hindered collection of the requisite large-scale prospective datasets required to inform disease management. We examined the efficacy of community-led data collection strategies using smartphones by smallholder farmers to acquire robust datasets from the trypanosomiasis endemic Shimba hills region in Kenya. We used Open Data Kit, an open-source smartphone application development software, to create a data collection App.

Results
Our study provides proof of concept for the viability of using smartphone Apps to remotely collect reliable large-scale information from smallholder farmers and veterinary health care givers in resource poor settings. We show that these datasets can be reliably collated remotely, analysed, and the findings can inform policies that improve farming practices and economic wellbeing while restricting widespread multi-drug resistance. Moreover, this strategy can be used to monitor and manage other infectious diseases in other rural, resource poor settings.},

	abstract = {Open Education Resources (OER) are geared towards promoting accessibility to education and to help overcome certain constraints to education associated with traditional ways of learning. However, these OERs can only be successfully rolled out and utilised in environments already enjoying certain infrastructural empowerments, including teacher-preparedness, availability of equipment to allow use of OERs and learner exposure and knowhow. This poses a major hurdle in many public and private schools in Kenya, which are in far-flung areas without electricity, mobile-phone connectivity, internet services and serviceable roads that allow movement to a cyber cafe where internet services may be accessed at a fee. These difficulties are encountered by both teachers and their learners. This paper seeks to discuss the challenges faced in implementation of OERs especially by the teachers who are expected to sensitise learners on the availability and utilisation of the OERs, while they themselves are either unaware of them, poorly trained to handle them or are under-facilitated to carry out their mandate. The study was carried out in Tharaka- Nithi County, Kenya. The County was chosen because challenges related to OER have been reported there. The county has 104 secondary schools. A sample size of 45 representing 20\% of the respondents was considered sufficient for the study. A questionnaire was used to obtain data on the teacher ICT competencies, their awareness of and attitudes towards OER and the challenges they teachers faced in implementation of OER. The study found that utilisation of OER stands at about 3\% as a result of ignorance regarding OER or a negative attitude towards them, poor ICT skills amongst the teachers and poor or inadequate resources within and around the schools.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial carbon stock estimates information has signi cant importance in planning decisions for amicable mitigation of global warming and climate change related disasters. However, conventional estimation methods are usually expensive and time demanding particularly on national or regional scales. Therefore, this study sought to estimate and analyze carbon stock changes in Kenya as a consequence of land cover change (LCC) using open data and software to provide a ordable and timely solutions. Using Random Forest (RF) decision trees, the land cover for 2028 was modelled from 2004 and 2016 land cover under Business as Usual (BAU) and an alternative, Reducing of Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation (REDD+) scenarios. The modelled land cover maps were thereafter input in InVEST carbon model for estimation and valuation of carbon stock between 2004 and 2028. The results show a 16\% decline in carbon stock between 2004 and 2028 with a likelihood of losing up to 21 billion US\$ under BAU scenario at a national level. On a regional scale, the results revealed a gradual decline in carbon stock in the Coastal and Central regions of the study area while other regions exhibited mixed results. However, the trend can be reversed by implementation of REDD+ scenario with a possible increase of 1.6\% between 2016 and 2028, translating to a gain of approximately 1 billion US\$. This study contributes to the understanding of spatiotemporal carbon stock changes under di erent scenarios for

	shorttitle = {Open {Education} {Resources} {Differentiation}},
	abstract = {The academic literature on open educational resources (OER) and practices in higher education has grown substantially over the past decade. OER is seen to offer endless possibilities for Sub-Saharan African universities by reducing costs of education, improving quality of education, as well as increasing access to quality education for all, among others. Sub-Saharan African universities though, are notably underrepresented in the literature, especially on differentiations, be it on access to or use and sharing of OER. This thesis synthesizes research carried out to develop a representative view of OER in three Sub-Saharan countries: Kenya, Ghana and South Africa. The study, which formed part of the Research on Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project, explores differentiation in terms of (i) digital proficiency; (ii) level of use of OER; (iii) awareness of licensing; and (iv) the perceived value of OER. This thesis examines a deliberate selection of twelve universities across the three countries with randomly sampled students and lecturers. Separate questionnaires for students and the lecturers were used, which generated a response from a total of 2249 students and 106 lecturers. Major findings are: (i) that there is a significant digital differentiation among lecturers and students in terms of their proficiency, devices used and internet accessibility; and (ii) that the awareness and appreciation of the OER concept and open licensing is generally low, but from the actual variety and types of processing by respondents of educational resources which may not be open, there is a preparedness towards openness in the future in all the three countries. Therefore, the universities can use these findings in considerating how to restructure their educational policies to incorporate OER in teaching and learning to enhance the quality of education.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the Africa image and map portal (AIMP) project’s origins and development, along with its applications to date. This paper includes methods and a step-by-step appendix so that the project can be reproduced at other institutions.

Design/methodology/approach
AIMP was created with a suite of free and open source software, including QGIS, Mapbox.js and GitHub. Built around the concept of an interactive index map, AIMP allows for geographic searching of maps, posters and images from Indiana University’s (IU) African Studies collections. This paper presents a case study for the use of this geographic discovery tool at an academic library.

Findings
AIMP has allowed comparison of collection strengths with research interests of IU African Studies affiliates and to make strategic collection development decisions that will best serve the authors’ patrons. The instruction applications of AIMP are also full of potential. To date, the Librarian for African Studies has used the portal to familiarize faculty, as well as undergraduate and graduate students, with the range of image and map resources available to them, in a variety of settings.

Social implications
AIMP allows researchers around the world to discover materials through a geographic search, dramatically connecting and increasing access to and discoverability of these important collections. The use of free and open source geospatial software (foss4g) means that the interface does not rely on an institution’s proprietary software-licensing agreements, making it replicable for other institutions. This use of foss4g widens access to maps, spatial data, images and posters of Africa held by IUL to a global audience.

Originality/value
While interactive index maps are popular among map libraries, AIMP uniquely acts as a discovery portal for a variety of media, including images and posters. In this way, AIMP works to overcome institutional silos and increase discoverability of these important collections to a global audience.},

	title = {Diffusion of open source integrated library systems in academic libraries in {Africa}},
	issn = {0143-5124},
	abstract = {Purpose
Libraries globally automate their operations and services using integrated library systems (ILS) to increase operational efficiency and meet the ever-evolving demands of their users. Open source ILS (OS ILS) has become more popular globally. The purpose of this paper is to better understand the diffusion of OS ILS in academic libraries in Uganda.

Design/methodology/approach
Rogers’ diffusion of innovation (DoI) supplemented by the fit-viability theory was used as a theoretical framework. A questionnaire was developed based on extant literature and distributed electronically to representative members of a Ugandan university library association.
Findings
The diffusion of OS ILS in Ugandan academic libraries approximates the S-curve expected based on DoI. Ugandan academic libraries are adopting OS ILS for more flexibility to meet changing needs at what is perceived as an affordable cost but not all are fully satisfied. Koha is the most adopted OS ILS and is also being considered by all libraries without any ILS or a proprietary ILS. The information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, organizational procurement policies and national procurement legislation, human resource capacity and limited finances are barriers to diffusion. The total cost of ownership and technical skills required are of particular concern for OS ILS.

Research limitations/implications
The research was limited to a single African country and the recommendations may not be transferable to other African countries. Future research can expand the survey, the countries studied and/or address the methodological limitations of this study.
Practical implications
When embarking upon library automation using OS ILS or migrating to an OS ILS solution libraries should consider their ICT infrastructure, local support community, available training and be realistic about the costs. Local library associations should provide guidance on OS ILS selection, ongoing training, and opportunities for knowledge sharing. LIS schools should consider expanding their curriculum to include library automation and, in Uganda incorporate training on Koha as OS ILS. Libraries and library associations should advocate to reduce restrictive organizational procurement policies and national procurement legislation.

Originality/value
Studies on country-level diffusion of ILS are comparatively few, particularly in African countries. This is the first country-level study of OS ILS diffusion in Uganda. This study can positively impact future patterns of diffusion for optimal deployment of OS ILS software by informing academic libraries, university management, library association, LIS schools, and policymakers in Uganda and across the African continent, and encouraging academics and researchers to teach and study library automation using OS ILS.},

	abstract = {Data‐sharing is a desired default in the field of public health and a source of much ethical deliberation. Sharing data potentially contributes the largest, most efficient source of scientific data, but is fraught with contextual challenges which make stakeholders, particularly those in under‐resourced contexts hesitant or slow to share. Relatively little empirical research has engaged stakeholders in discussing the issue. This study sought to explore relevant experiences, contextual, and subjective explanations around the topic to provide a rich and detailed presentation of what it means to different stakeholders and contexts to share data and how that can guide practice and ethical guidance. A qualitative design involving interviews was undertaken with professionals working in public health institutions endowed with data (HDSS), ethics committees, and advisory agencies which help shape health research in Africa. A descriptive form of thematic analysis was used to summarize results into six key themes: (1) The role of HDSSs in research using public health data and data‐sharing; (2) Ownership and funding are critical factors influencing data‐sharing; (3) Other factors discourage data‐sharing; (4) Promoting and sustaining data‐sharing; (5) Ethical guidance structures; and (6) Establishing effective guidance. The themes reveal factors regarding the willingness or not to share and an intricate ethical system that current discourse could reflect. Many of the concerns resonate with the literature, but a whole other gamut of people and process issues; commitments, investments, careers, and the right ethical guidance are needed to realize a sustainable goal of reaching ‘share’ as a default.},

	issn = {2398-5348},
	abstract = {Purpose
Given that repositories were proposed as one of the routes to open access (OA), this study sought to establish the achievements universities in East Africa had attained in initiating institutional repositories (IRs), the challenges in providing OA and strategies for the way forward.

Design/methodology/approach
Data were collected through literature searches, using the internet, journal databases and university websites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for information about OA and IRs in East Africa. Some of the findings were based on the author’s PhD “The management and accessibility of OA IRs in selected universities in East Africa”, which used face-to-face interviews with six librarians and self-administered questionnaires responded to by 183 researchers at Kenyatta University, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and Makerere University.
Findings
Universities in East Africa were still in the intermediate stages of embracing OA, and only 40 libraries out of 145 universities had implemented IRs. However, most of the repositories had less than 1,000 items, with this challenge attributed to the absence of institutional and government/funder mandates that affected the collection/provision of OA, in addition to the lack of awareness of IRs among researchers.

Originality/value
The value in this research was establishing the extent of IR initiatives in universities in East Africa and their contribution to OA, which is regarded as more visible and accessible to scholars and government personnel who could leverage the information for further development in the region.},

In Africa, the concept is relatively new and implementing Open Science initiatives can be complicated. Open Science is good for Africa. There are several benefits to be derived by stakeholders from opening the continent’s science research process and outputs to the world. But, Open Science for what? And whose mandate is it to ensure that Africa pursues and derives maximum benefits from Open Science? This paper argues that Open Science initiatives should address the challenges faced by the continent and should support national and Africa wide development agendas. Governments should put in place policy frameworks for Open Science and mandate institutions that are coordinating science, technology and innovation (STI) research to lead national Open Science initiatives. Increased public funding for STI research is key to implementing successful Open Science initiatives. Africa is home to several opportunities that could spur investments in research.},

	abstract = {The worldwide slum population currently stands at over one billion, with substantial growth expected in the coming decades. Traditionally, slums have been mapped using information derived mainly from either physical indicators using remote sensing data, or socio-economic indicators using census data. Each data source on its own provides only a partial view of slums, an issue further compounded by data poverty in less-developed countries. To overcome such issues, this paper explores the fusion of traditional with emerging open data sources and data mining tools to identify additional indicators that can be used to detect and map the presence of slums, map their footprint, and map their evolution. Towards this goal, we develop an indicator database for slums using open sources of physical and socio-economic data that can be used to characterize slum settlements. Using this database, we then leverage data mining techniques to identify the most suitable combination of these indicators for mapping slums. Using three cities in Kenya as test cases, results show that the fusion of these data can improve the mapping accuracy of slums. These results suggest that the proposed approach can provide a viable solution to the emerging challenge of monitoring the growth of slums.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (lCTs) use in public and private sectors and the fast growing Internet access, Institutions of higher learning have no choice but to adopt these technologies if they have to be relevant in this information age. This study aimed at examining the organizational determinants affecting the adoption of open source software in institution of higher learning in Kenya with special reference to Inoorero University. The specific objectives of the study were; to find out how organizational size affects the use of OSS, to examine the effect of organizational structure on the adoption of OSS, to assess the effect of organizational culture on the adoption and use of OSS in the institution of higher learning and lastly to assess the role of the management in the adoption of OSS in institution of higher learning in Kenya. The study used descriptive survey in carrying out the investigation. This study adopted comprehensive qualitative analysis where a careful and complete scrutiny and understanding of the situations in the institutions was done. The target population of the study consisted of; students, teaching staff and management at Inoorero University, School of Information Technology who were 500 in total. The study used both the stratified sampling techniques and the simple random sampling in the determination of the sample. A sample of 150 respondents was selected from whom data was collected. The study used the questionnaire to collect the data of which 137 were returned and analysed. The Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient was used to test the reliability of the instruments which yielded a value of 0.891, hence the instruments were considered reliable. The data collected was summarized and presented using both descriptive such as frequencies and percentages and inferential statistics such as the correlation and regression analysis. The results show that the adoption of OSS in the institutions of higher learning was determined by organizational size, organizational structure, role of management and the organizational culture. The correlation analysis showed that organizational size had the highest influence in the adoption of OSS in the learning institution. From the regression analysis it showed that the four factors considered in the study influenced the adoption of OSS by only 22.5\%. The study recommends that if the results of this research are implemented by the government of Kenya they can be beneficial to the students and staff of the university and shall form a basis for more research involving the public and private sectors in Kenya. The results would also help in ensuring quality and standardization of the various educational programs at the university level.},

	abstract = {Web based Geographic Information System has added a new dimension on how spatial information is shared, displayed, processed and disseminated in an easy and quick way which in turn assists different decision makers and stakeholders interested in spatial related development projects. On the other hand, the use of Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) software presents a cost-effective means of implementing, operating and maintaining spatial information over the web with the similar capabilities and features of commercial GIS software. The County Government of Vihiga has embarked on a governance transformation aimed at having development activities (from design, planning, implementation to monitoring and evaluation) undertaken on a GIS platform. Until recently, no effort had been made to spatially make available, on a web platform, development projects to different stakeholders to enable monitoring and evaluation. As part of ensuring different users are able to appreciate the appropriateness of GIS in enhancing Monitoring and evaluation of projects, there is need to develop a user-friendly system for thin clients1 to enable them be part of the daily running of County Government projects as well as ensure accountability by the relevant departments. The main objective of this study is to develop an Open Source Web-based Spatial Information System aimed at providing collection, storage and dissemination of development projects to enable monitoring and evaluation. The methodology adopted in developing the system included User needs assessment and data collection of development projects from the County Government of Vihiga, data analysis and development of a database management system using QGIS and PostgreSQL /PostGIS as the Spatial Database Management System, System used GeoServer as the Map Server, publishing of digital layers as dynamic maps using Open Layers, OpenStreetMap and Google earth and development of an interactive Graphic User Interface framework which is interactive and can perform queries using Node.js. This GUI integrated all the components of the Spatial Information System in one platform easily accessed on a web browser. Scripts and codes were generated using the freely available Javascript Libraries (Open Layers and Node.js). The installation of these libraries involved a HTML (North\_Maragoli.html) document which was a reference to library location in the server system hosted locally. The resultant OpenStreetMap can be embedded into the county website for visualization and thin client spatial analysis. The results of the study was a n working Spatial Information System with capabilities spatial analysis and querying of projects. This system is envisioned to assist the county governments with similar projects in enhancing monitoring and evaluation as well as promote transparency and accountability as they seeks to improve service delivery at the county level. The system has the potential to be scaled up to the World Wide Web level. The availability of this system on the World Wide Web is envisioned encourage multi-stakeholder interaction aimed at facilitating data exchange, stakeholder participation in monitoring and evaluation of projects and improve decision making},

	abstract = {Though the OER movement has been in existence for over a decade now, less has been said on their integration in the academic Libraries. Academic libraries may hold institutional content such as syllabi and past exam papers but Inclusion of lecture notes, presentations, and assessment materials has not been a common practice in the university libraries. It was noted that even if the materials are found in electronic formats these contents remains closed in virtual learning environments and are controlled by the lecturers or the departments providing the course. Their integration with library resources and search facilities including the online public access catalogue (OPAC) is generally insufficient. This project presents a study on the Integration of OER to facilitate teaching and learning in Kenya. To realize this the study sought to examine the available OER integration strategies in the selected academic libraries, assess the type of OER’s integrated in the academic libraries, establish the OER policy that govern the integration of OER, establish the adopted licensing mechanisms in the integration of OER’s and
finally to explore the challenges faced by academic libraries in the integration of OER. An emphasis was placed on two public and two private academic libraries that is Kenyatta University library, Multimedia University, Catholic University of Eastern Africa and Africa Nazarene University. The four universities presented a representation of academic universities in Kenya and it formed a baseline for a an OER study in Kenya and three of the university have embraced Open Distance and ELearning (ODEL).The study’s respondent included the university librarians and the library staff. The study used a population of 89 respondents. The research used census method of determining the sample size and thereby took the 89 to be the sample size. Data was collected using questionnaires, Interviews and secondary sources. Data from the respondents was presented using table, graphs and charts. The researcher noted that most of the academic libraries in Kenya have only integrated the E-books and E-Journals as the only OER’s.
Two of the university libraries have partnered with external OER providers and have integrated external OER’s. True to the statement of the problem most of the Educational materials are locked into the ODEL platforms and not to the libraries. Only one university has formulated an OER’s policy though it’s not functional, the others use openaccess collection development and others uses the ICT policies in the integration of OER. Most of the Universities use creative commons licenses in the sharing of the OER’s.
Some recommendations were made which includes; development of OER policies, having OER awareness campaigns, collaborating with national, regional and international organizations that provides OER and finally to solicit for funds for the sustainability of the OER initiatives. Further research was recommended on the role of faculty members in the integration of OER in the institution of higher learning.},

Based on the longitudinal case study of the Ministry of Health in Kenya, the paper analyses how the adoption and usage of technology has influenced the structures of its health management information systems and the related implications for the health service delivery. The analysis focus onto the human-mediated interplay between the intrinsic material features of the IT artefact and the main elements of the surrounding institutional and technological environment and their influence in relation to the donor-driven reforms of the health sector. Empirical results are then used to critically discuss the main implications of the institutional and technological environment characterizing Government IT innovations in developing countries such as Kenya for the development of local OSS sustainable products. Finally, the main factors identified are then used to build an OSS business model analysis framework. The framework can be used to better understand the major issues that need to be addressed at different institutional levels for the sustainability of OSS in the Governments of developing countries.},
