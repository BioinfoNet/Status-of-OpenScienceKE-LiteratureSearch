	abstract = {With the volume of molecular sequence data that is systematically being generated globally, there is a need for centralized resources for data exploration and analytics. DNA Barcode initiatives are on track to generate a compendium of molecular sequence–based signatures for identifying animals and plants. To date, the range of available data exploration and analytic tools to explore these data have only been available in a boutique form—often representing a frustrating hurdle for many researchers that may not necessarily have resources to install or implement algorithms described by the analytic community. The Barcode of Life Data Portal (BDP) is a first step towards integrating the latest biodiversity informatics innovations with molecular sequence data from DNA barcoding. Through establishment of community driven standards, based on discussion with the Data Analysis Working Group (DAWG) of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL), the BDP provides an infrastructure for incorporation of existing and next-generation DNA barcode analytic applications in an open forum.},

	abstract = {The population genetics and phylogeography of African phytophagous insects have received little attention. Some, such as the maize stalk borer Busseola fusca, display significant geographic differences in ecological preferences that may be congruent with patterns of molecular variation. To test this, we collected 307 individuals of this species from maize and cultivated sorghum at 52 localities in West, Central and East Africa during the growing season. For all collected individuals, we sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b. We tested hypotheses concerning the history and demographic structure of this species. Phylogenetic analyses and nested clade phylogeographic analyses (NCPA) separated the populations into three mitochondrial clades, one from West Africa, and two--Kenya I and Kenya II--from East and Central Africa. The similar nucleotide divergence between clades and nucleotide diversity within clades suggest that they became isolated at about the same time in three different refuges in sub-Saharan Africa and have similar demographic histories. The results of mismatch distribution analyses were consistent with the demographic expansion of these clades. Analysis of molecular variance (amova) indicated a high level of geographic differentiation at different hierarchical levels. NCPA suggested that the observed distribution of haplotypes at several hierarchical levels within the three major clades is best accounted for by restricted gene flow with isolation by distance. The domestication of sorghum and the introduction of maize in Africa had no visible effect on the geographic patterns observed in the B. fusca mitochondrial genome.},

	volume = {51},
	abstract = {The genus Dacus Fabricius includes economically important pest fruit flies distributed in the Afrotropical and Indo-Australian regions. Two recent revisions based on morphological characters proposed new and partially discordant classifications synonymizing/revalidating several subgeneric names and forming species groups. Regardless these efforts, the phylogenetic relationships among Dacus species remained largely unresolved mainly because of the difficulties in assigning homologous character states. Therefore we investigated the phylogeny of African Dacus by sequencing 71 representatives of 32 species at two mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and one nuclear (period) gene fragments. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred through Bayesian and Maximum Parsimony methods and hypotheses about the monophyly of Dacus subgenera were tested by Shimodaira–Hasegawa tests. The congruence tests and the analyses of the single gene fragments revealed that the nuclear gene supports similar conclusions as the two mitochondrial genes. Levels of intra- and inter-specific differentiation of Dacus species were highly variable and, in some cases, largely overlapping. The analyses of the concatenated dataset resolved two major bootstrap-supported groups as well as a number of well-supported clades and subclades that often comprised representatives of different subgenera. Additionally, specimens of Dacus humeralis from Eastern and Western African localities formed separate clades, suggesting cryptic differentiation within this taxon. The comparisons between the molecular phylogeny and the morphological classification revealed a number of discrepancies and, in the vast majority of cases, the molecular data were not compatible with the monophyly of the currently recognised subgenera. Conversely, the molecular data showed that Apocynaceae feeders are a monophyletic sister group of species feeding on both Cucurbitaceae and Passifloraceae (these latter being also monophyletic). These results show a clear association between the molecular phylogeny of African Dacus and the evolution of host plant choice and provide a basis towards a more congruent taxonomy of this genus.},

	volume = {64},
	abstract = {With well over 700 species, the Tribe Dacini is one of the most species-rich clades within the dipteran family Tephritidae, the true fruit flies. Nearly all Dacini belong to one of two very large genera, Dacus Fabricius and Bactrocera Macquart. The distribution of the genera overlap in or around the Indian subcontinent, but the greatest diversity of Dacus is in Africa and the greatest diversity of Bactrocera is in south-east Asia and the Pacific. The monophyly of these two genera has not been rigorously established, with previous phylogenies only including a small number of species and always heavily biased to one genus over the other. Moreover, the subgeneric taxonomy within both genera is complex and the monophyly of many subgenera has not been explicitly tested. Previous hypotheses about the biogeography of the Dacini based on morphological reviews and current distributions of taxa have invoked an out-of-India hypothesis; however this has not been tested in a phylogenetic framework. We attempted to resolve these issues with a dated, molecular phylogeny of 125 Dacini species generated using 16S, COI, COII and white eye genes. The phylogeny shows that Bactrocera is not monophyletic, but rather consists of two major clades: Bactrocera s.s. and the 'Zeugodacus group of subgenera' (a recognised, but informal taxonomic grouping of 15 Bactrocera subgenera). This 'Zeugodacus' clade is the sister group to Dacus, not Bactrocera and, based on current distributions, split from Dacus before that genus moved into Africa. We recommend that taxonomic consideration be given to raising Zeugodacus to genus level. Supportive of predictions following from the out-of-India hypothesis, the first common ancestor of the Dacini arose in the mid-Cretaceous approximately 80mya. Major divergence events occurred during the Indian rafting period and diversification of Bactrocera apparently did not begin until after India docked with Eurasia (50-35mya). In contrast, diversification in Dacus, at approximately 65mya, apparently began much earlier than predicted by the out-of-India hypothesis, suggesting that, if the Dacini arose on the Indian plate, then ancestral Dacus may have left the plate in the mid to late Cretaceous via the well documented India-Madagascar-Africa migration route. We conclude that the phylogeny does not disprove the predictions of an out-of-India hypothesis for the Dacini, although modification of the original hypothesis is required.},

Applications of phylogeography are broad, and in the context of pathogens include the reconstruction of transmission histories and the origin and emergence of outbreaks. Phylogeographic inference based on bottom-up population genetics models is computationally expensive, and as a result faster alternatives based on the evolution of discrete traits have become popular. In this paper, we show that inference of migration rates and root locations based on discrete trait models is extremely unreliable and sensitive to biased sampling. To address this problem, we introduce BASTA (BAyesian STructured coalescent Approximation), a new approach implemented in BEAST2 that combines the accuracy of methods based on the structured coalescent with the computational efficiency required to handle more than just few populations. We illustrate the potentially severe implications of poor model choice for phylogeographic analyses by investigating the zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus. Whereas the structured coalescent analysis correctly infers that successive human Ebola outbreaks have been seeded by a large unsampled non-human reservoir population, the discrete trait analysis implausibly concludes that undetected human-to-human transmission has allowed the virus to persist over the past four decades. As genomics takes on an increasingly prominent role informing the control and prevention of infectious diseases, it will be vital that phylogeographic inference provides robust insights into transmission history.},

	abstract = {Background
Techniques for reconstructing geographical history along a phylogeny can answer many questions of interest about the geographical origins of species. Bayesian models based on the assumption that taxa move through a diffusion process have found many applications. However, these methods rely on diffusion processes on a plane, and do not take the spherical nature of our planet in account. Performing an analysis that covers the whole world thus does not take in account the distortions caused by projections like the Mercator projection.

Results
In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian phylogeographical method based on diffusion on a sphere. When the area where taxa are sampled from is small, a sphere can be approximated by a plane and the model results in the same inferences as with models using diffusion on a plane. For taxa sampled from the whole world, we obtain substantial differences. We present an efficient algorithm for performing inference in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and show applications to small and large samples areas. We compare results between planar and spherical diffusion in a simulation study and apply the method by inferring the origin of Hepatitis B based on sequences sampled from Eurasia and Africa.

Conclusions
We describe a framework for performing phylogeographical inference, which is suitable when the distortion introduced by map projections is large, but works well on a smaller scale as well. The framework allows sampling tips from regions, which is useful when the exact sample location is unknown, and placing prior information on locations of clades in the tree. The method is implemented in the GEO\_SPHERE package in BEAST 2, which is open source licensed under LGPL and allows joint tree and geography inference under a wide range of models.},

The present investigation addresses this gap, examining the phylogeography of Sida crystallina, a species whose production of diapausing eggs capable of passive dispersal was thought to constrain its regional genetic differentiation. By contrast, the present analysis has revealed deep allozyme and cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial DNA divergence between populations from North America and Europe. Moreover, North American populations are separated into four allopatric assemblages, whose distribution suggests their derivation from different Pleistocene refugia. These lineages show higher haplotype diversity and deeper sequence divergence than those of any fish from temperate North America. Its distinctive life history traits have evidently sheltered lineages of Sida from extinction, contributing to a remarkably comprehensive and high resolution phylogeographic record.},

The environmental heterogeneity abets organism colonization into new sites and induces adaptive genetic changes in them by creating separation at specific loci. Phylogeography encodes the spatial and temporal distribution of population structure in relation to their ecological and biological requirements which can decipher evolutionary processes.

Although these aims can be associated, they are quite distinct and require different methodological approaches, but their conflation has led to the frequently inappropriate use of commonly used analytical methods such as neighbour-joining trees, bootstrap resampling and fixed distance thresholds. Furthermore, the misidentification of voucher specimens can also have serious implications for end users of reference libraries such as the Barcode of Life Data Systems, and in this regard we advocate increased diligence in the a priori identification of specimens to be used for this purpose.

The compounds serve as a deterrent to conspecifics avoiding over-infestation of hosts (i.e. repeated egg-laying into an already occupied/used host). If these HMPs are sprayed onto commercially valuable fruit they act as deterrents preventing attack by females interested in laying eggs into the valuable commodity. Having no insecticidal or toxic properties, and being natural products (or close derivatives thereof) they could be used as fruit sprays to replace insecticides, or in combination with other products to improve efficacy. This review discusses the isolation, and synthesis of the HMP of the Mexican fruit fly Anastrepha ludens a feared pest of citrus and mangos in Mexico and Central America. This compound is also recognized by females of other pestiferous species in the same genus Anastrepha distributed from the Southern USA to Northern Argentina, including many Caribbean Islands. The synthetic HMP was shown to exhibit strong electrophysiological activity against A. ludens and excellent interspecies cross recognition with other Anastrepha species. Behavioural tests confirmed the HMP deterring effect of the synthetic natural product. Further studies enabled us to drastically simplify the structure of the HMP and obtain a derivative, which we named Anastrephamide, which shows HMP deterring effects very similar to the natural product in laboratory and field tests. The potential use of such HMP derivatives in a crop protection scenario is briefly discussed.},

Taxonomic research was largely driven by the work of two entomologists at that time: Mario Bezzi (Italy) and Kenneth Munro (South Africa). In the latter part of the twentieth century and the first decades of this century, more comprehensive publications became available dealing both with generic revisions and higher classification. Again the greatest focus was on those groups comprising fruit flies of economic significance, including studies dealing with cryptic species. Considerable progress was also made with descriptions of other tephritid groups, although they received far less attention and it is expected that numerous new species await description. These taxonomic studies form the basis of studies on the phylogenetic relationships amongst the taxa, using both morphological and molecular data. Increasingly, greater attention is being given to putting this information into a larger evolutionary framework, in particular with respect to host plant associations.},

Complex phylogenetic relationships and localised conflict in phylogenetic signals were observed within subtribe Dacina with (a) Dacus, (b) Bactrocera (Zeugodacus) and (c) all other Bactrocera species forming separate clades. The subgenus Bactrocera (Zeugodacus) is therefore raised to generic rank (Zeugodacus Hendel stat. nov.). Additionally, Bactrocera subgenera grouped under the Zeugodacus group should be considered under new generic combinations. Although there are indications that Zeugodacus and Dacus are sister groups, the exact relationship between Zeugodacus stat. nov., Dacus and Bactrocera still needs to be properly resolved.},

It has been suggested that these species merged into several hybrid swarm populations, although a mitochondrial phylogeography revealed substructure with local differentiation. We analysed a three-gene mt-dataset (889 individuals) and 12 microsatellite loci (892 individuals). Microsatellite analyses revealed an overall weak differentiation and corroborated the superordinate division into two clusters. The data indicate that the populations studied belong to only one species according to the biological species concept, refuting the opening hypothesis. A future taxonomic revision appears necessary to reflect the division into two subgroups. Ancestral mitochondrial polymorphisms are retained in H. euphorbiae, indicating gene flow within a broad ‘glacial refuge belt’ and ongoing postglacial gene flow. Diverse patterns of extensive mito-nuclear discordance in the Mediterranean and the Middle East presumably evolved by more recent processes. This discordance indicates introgression of H. tithymali-related mitochondrial haplogroups, accompanied (to a lesser degree) by nuclear alleles, into Italian and Aegean H. euphorbiae populations as recently as the late Holocene. The complex mosaic of divergence and reintegration is assumed to have been influenced by locally differing environmental barriers to gene flow.},

We compared the results with those from an earlier study on the same but slightly shorter gradient that relied solely on morphological criteria to discriminate species. The present analysis revealed 1857 putative species, an 80\% increase in species richness from the earlier study that detected only 1010 species. Measures of species richness and diversity that are less dependent on sample size were more than twice as high as in the earlier study, even when analysis was restricted to an identical elevational range. The estimated total number of geometrid species (new dataset) in the sampled area is 2350. Species richness at single sites was 32–43\% higher, and the beta diversity component rose by 43–51\%. These impacts of DNA barcoding on measures of richness reflect its capacity to reveal cryptic species that were overlooked in the first study. The overall results confirmed unique diversity patterns reported in the first investigation. Species diversity was uniformly high along the gradient, declining only slightly above 2800 m. Species turnover also showed little variation along the gradient, reinforcing the lack of evidence for discrete faunal zones. By confirming these major biodiversity patterns, the present study establishes that incomplete species delineation does not necessarily conceal trends of biodiversity along ecological gradients, but it impedes determination of the true magnitude of diversity and species turnover.},

OTUs supported by all three approaches were viewed as robust, but 20\% of the OTUs were only recognized by one or two of the methods. These OTUs were examined for three criteria to clarify their status. Monophyly and diagnostic nucleotides were both uninformative, but information on ranges was useful as sympatric sister OTUs were viewed as distinct, while allopatric OTUs were merged. This approach revealed 124 OTUs of Hypertrophinae, a more than twofold increase from the currently recognized 51 species. Because this analytical protocol is both fast and repeatable, it provides a valuable tool for establishing a basic understanding of species boundaries that can be validated with subsequent studies.},

	abstract = {Background
A so called “taxonomic impediment” has been recognized as a major obstacle to biodiversity research for the past two decades. Numerous remedies were then proposed. However, neither significant progress in terms of formal species descriptions, nor a minimum standard for descriptions have been achieved so far. Here, we analyze the problems of traditional taxonomy which often produces keys and descriptions of limited practical value. We suggest that phylogenetics and phenetics had a subtle and so far unnoticed effect on taxonomy leading to inflated species descriptions.

Discussion
The term “turbo-taxonomy” was recently coined for an approach combining cox1 sequences, concise morphological descriptions by an expert taxonomist, and high-resolution digital imaging to streamline the formal description of larger numbers of new species. We propose a further development of this approach which, together with open access web-publication and automated pushing of content from journal into a wiki, may create the most efficient and sustainable way to conduct taxonomy in the future. On demand, highly concise descriptions can be gradually updated or modified in the fully versioned wiki-framework we use. This means that the visibility of additional data is not compromised, while the original species description -the first version- remains preserved in the wiki, and of course in the journal version. A DNA sequence database with an identification engine replaces an identification key, helps to avoid synonyms and has the potential to detect grossly incorrect generic placements. We demonstrate the functionality of a species-description pipeline by naming 101 new species of hyperdiverse New Guinea Trigonopterus weevils in the open-access journal ZooKeys.

Summary
Fast track taxonomy will not only increase speed, but also sustainability of global species inventories. It will be of great practical value to all the other disciplines that depend on a usable taxonomy and will change our perception of global biodiversity. While this approach is certainly not suitable for all taxa alike, it is the tool that will help to tackle many hyperdiverse groups and pave the road for more sustainable comparative studies, e.g. in community ecology, phylogeography and large scale biogeographic studies.},

	abstract = {Kenya began popularizing DNA barcoding in 2006 after hosting a CBOL regional workshop in Nairobi. Since then, there have been efforts to come up with regional and national programmes that would utilize the technique. With the support of CBOL and CCDB, Kenya has benefitted in capacity development in DNA barcoding. Earlier surveys of fish, Tsetse fly and stingless bees had contributed to barcode references. DNA barcoding activities have also been extended in diverse local universities and laboratories under individual scientists. On a national level however, implementation of DNA barcoding has been slow due to insufficient expertise, funding, infrastructure and a national framework of operation. 

Popularization of DNA barcoding in Kenya required a framework to strengthen existing national networks. Through the global campaigns and the International Barcode of Life project (iBOL) a mechanisms was put in place to enhance national DNA barcoding operations. The IDRC supported KenBOL, steered by ICIPE and National Museums of Kenya (NMK) was therefore created to mainstream IDRC project objectives into various sectors of development in Kenya. A platform was subsequently created by KenBOL which brought together a team from key institutions dealing with biodiversity conservation and management, agriculture and health issues in Kenya. The team established an operating structure for KenBOL and adopted thematic areas that cover various sectors of development which include disease vectors, pollinators, fishes, mammals (bushmeat and endangered species), plants (medicinal and others), birds, plant pests and parasitoids. 

IDRC-KenBOL project, has encouraged a strong network among participating institutions and programmes. Over the last eight months, KenBOL has registered approximately 5,216 specimens and about 33\% have been barcoded in BOLD system. In addition to this effort, KenBOL has held several training seminars to partner institutions on field sampling techniques, data and laboratory management for DNA barcoding.},

We demonstrate how DNA barcoding helps address the failure of current inventory methods to rapidly respond to pressing biodiversity needs, specifically in the assessment of richness and turnover across landscapes with hyperdiverse taxa. In a comparison of inventories at four localities in northern Madagascar, patterns of richness were not significantly different when richness was determined using morphological taxonomy (morphospecies) or sequence divergence thresholds (Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit(s); MOTU). However, sequence-based methods tended to yield greater richness and significantly lower indices of similarity than morphological taxonomy. MOTU determined using our molecular technique were a remarkably local phenomenon—indicative of highly restricted dispersal and/or long-term isolation. In cases where molecular and morphological methods differed in their assignment of individuals to categories, the morphological estimate was always more conservative than the molecular estimate. In those cases where morphospecies descriptions collapsed distinct molecular groups, sequence divergences of 16\% (on average) were contained within the same morphospecies. Such high divergences highlight taxa for further detailed genetic, morphological, life history, and behavioral studies.},

The use of DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the genome, has recently been proposed as a tool to facilitate species identification and discovery.

Here we show that cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcodes effectively discriminate among species in three Lepidoptera families from Area de Conservación Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. We found that 97.9\% of the 521 species recognized by prior taxonomic work possess distinctive cytochrome c oxidase I barcodes and that the few instances of interspecific sequence overlap involve very similar species. We also found two or more barcode clusters within each of 13 supposedly single species.

	abstract = {Many of the similarities in visual ecology between the Nematocera and Brachycera and within the Cyclorrhapha may reflect the evolution of blood-feeding in these groups. In Nematocera and Brachycera, blood-feeding is thought to have evolved from predatory or nectar-feeding behavior (138). Only females feed on hosts, and association with hosts generally occurs when hosts are close to the aquatic or semiaquatic habitats of the immatures. Flies feed on nectar, make appetitive flights, disperse, or migrate prior to blood-feeding, and then oviposit in water. Many species are nocturnal or crepuscular. In Cyclorrhapha, flies are closely associated with hosts. They may have arisen from compost-feeding flies that developed a larval dependence on vertebrate-produced microhabitats. Both sexes blood-feed, and mating occurs on or near hosts. Flies generally emerge in the proximity of hosts and maintain close contact with them. These species are diurnal, and their visual systems are well developed. Comparisons between closely related blood-feeding and non-blood-feeding species may provide insight into the visual ecology of blood-feeding species. Despite the different origins of hematophagy, there appears to be a convergence of morphology and behavior that is related to ecology rather than to phylogenetic relationships. This is clearly seen in host-location strategies by tsetse and tabanids. Even within groups such as mosquitoes, species that are active at the same time of day and in the same habitat have more in common than closely related species in different habitats. For this reason, an ecological review would be more cohesive than this phylogenetic discussion. However, because of the disproportionate amount of literature on a small number of groups, the phylogenetic approach is the most practical for this subject. However, this review does point out the great need for research on the less well-studied groups and behaviors.},

This research evaluates the utility of a sequence-based approach for two mitochondrial (COI and ND6) gene regions. We use these markers to examine genetic diversity, estimate population structure, and identify diagnostic information for A. ludens populations. We analyzed 543 individuals from 67 geographic collections and found one predominant haplotype occurring in the majority of specimens. We observed 68 haplotypes in all and see differences among haplotypes belonging to northern and southern collections. Mexico haplotypes differ by few bases possibly as a result of a recent bottleneck event. In contrast to the hypothesis suggesting northeastern Mexico as the origin of this species, we see that specimens from two southern collections show high genetic variability delineating three mitochondrial groups. These data suggest that Central America is the origin for A. ludens. We show that COI and ND6 are useful for phylogeographic studies of A. ludens.},

GSH was isolated from the aqueous extract of adult female fecal matter and characterized by LC-QTOF-MS. GSH level increased with increasing age of female fecal matter, with highest concentration detected from 2-week-old adult females. Additionally, GSH levels were 5-10-times higher in fecal matter than in the ovipositor or hemolymph extracts of females. In bioassays, synthetic GSH reduced oviposition responses in conspecifics of C. cosyra and the heterospecific species C. rosa, C. fasciventris, C. capitata, and Zeugodacus cucurbitae.

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Current methods to identify unknown insect (class Insecta) cytochrome c oxidase (COI barcode) sequences often rely on thresholds of distances that can be difficult to define, sequence similarity cut-offs, or monophyly. Some of the most commonly used metagenomic classification methods do not provide a measure of confidence for the taxonomic assignments they provide. The aim of this study was to use a naïve Bayesian classifier (Wang et al.
Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 2007; 73: 5261) to automate taxonomic assignments for large batches of insect COI sequences such as data obtained from high-throughput environmental sequencing. This method provides rank-flexible taxonomic assignments with an associated bootstrap support value, and it is faster than the blast-based methods commonly used in environmental sequence surveys. We have developed and rigorously tested the performance of three different training sets using leave-one-out cross-validation, two field data sets, and targeted testing of Lepidoptera, Diptera and Mantodea sequences obtained from the Barcode of Life Data system. We found that type I error rates, incorrect taxonomic assignments with a high bootstrap support, were already relatively low but could be lowered further by ensuring that all query taxa are actually present in the reference database. Choosing bootstrap support cut-offs according to query length and summarizing taxonomic assignments to more inclusive ranks can also help to reduce error while retaining the maximum number of assignments. Additionally, we highlight gaps in the taxonomic and geographic representation of insects in public sequence databases that will require further work by taxonomists to improve the quality of assignments generated using any method.},

	abstract = {Background
We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “CAT” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

Conclusions/Significance
FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

	abstract = {Statistical methods for phylogeny estimation, especially maximum likelihood (ML), offer high accuracy with excellent theoretical properties. However, RAxML, the current leading method for large-scale ML estimation, can require weeks or longer when used on datasets with thousands of molecular sequences. Faster methods for ML estimation, among them FastTree, have also been developed, but their relative performance to RAxML is not yet fully understood. In this study, we explore the performance with respect to ML score, running time, and topological accuracy, of FastTree and RAxML on thousands of alignments (based on both simulated and biological nucleotide datasets) with up to 27,634 sequences. We find that when RAxML and FastTree are constrained to the same running time, FastTree produces topologically much more accurate trees in almost all cases. We also find that when RAxML is allowed to run to completion, it provides an advantage over FastTree in terms of the ML score, but does not produce substantially more accurate tree topologies. Interestingly, the relative accuracy of trees computed using FastTree and RAxML depends in part on the accuracy of the sequence alignment and dataset size, so that FastTree can be more accurate than RAxML on large datasets with relatively inaccurate alignments. Finally, the running times of RAxML and FastTree are dramatically different, so that when run to completion, RAxML can take several orders of magnitude longer than FastTree to complete. Thus, our study shows that very large phylogenies can be estimated very quickly using FastTree, with little (and in some cases no) degradation in tree accuracy, as compared to RAxML.},

	abstract = {Background
Comparative analysis of RNA sequences is the basis for the detailed and accurate predictions of RNA structure and the determination of phylogenetic relationships for organisms that span the entire phylogenetic tree. Underlying these accomplishments are very large, well-organized, and processed collections of RNA sequences. This data, starting with the sequences organized into a database management system and aligned to reveal their higher-order structure, and patterns of conservation and variation for organisms that span the phylogenetic tree, has been collected and analyzed. This type of information can be fundamental for and have an influence on the study of phylogenetic relationships, RNA structure, and the melding of these two fields.

Results
We have prepared a large web site that disseminates our comparative sequence and structure models and data. The four major types of comparative information and systems available for the three ribosomal RNAs (5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and two of the catalytic intron RNAs (group I and group II) are: (1) Current Comparative Structure Models; (2) Nucleotide Frequency and Conservation Information; (3) Sequence and Structure Data; and (4) Data Access Systems.

Conclusions
This online RNA sequence and structure information, the result of extensive analysis, interpretation, data collection, and computer program and web development, is accessible at our Comparative RNA Web (CRW) Site http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu. In the future, more data and information will be added to these existing categories, new categories will be developed, and additional RNAs will be studied and presented at the CRW Site.},

Lack of parallelization is still a challenge for MSA research.Results: We developed two software tools to address the DNA MSA problem. The first employed trie trees to accelerate the centre star MSA strategy. The expected time complexity was decreased to linear time from square time. To address large-scale data, parallelism was applied using the hadoop platform. Experiments demonstrated the performance of our proposed methods, including their running time, sum-of-pairs scores and scalability. Moreover, we supplied two massive DNA/RNA MSA datasets for further testing and research.Availability and implementation: The codes, tools and data are accessible free of charge at http://datamining.xmu.edu.cn/software/halign/.Contact:zouquan@nclab.net or ghwang@hit.edu.cn},

	abstract = {Background
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) plays a key role in biological sequence analyses, especially in phylogenetic tree construction. Extreme increase in next-generation sequencing results in shortage of efficient ultra-large biological sequence alignment approaches for coping with different sequence types.

Methods
Distributed and parallel computing represents a crucial technique for accelerating ultra-large (e.g. files more than 1 GB) sequence analyses. Based on HAlign and Spark distributed computing system, we implement a highly cost-efficient and time-efficient HAlign-II tool to address ultra-large multiple biological sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction.

Results
The experiments in the DNA and protein large scale data sets, which are more than 1GB files, showed that HAlign II could save time and space. It outperformed the current software tools. HAlign-II can efficiently carry out MSA and construct phylogenetic trees with ultra-large numbers of biological sequences. HAlign-II shows extremely high memory efficiency and scales well with increases in computing resource.

Conclusions
THAlign-II provides a user-friendly web server based on our distributed computing infrastructure. HAlign-II with open-source codes and datasets was established at http://lab.malab.cn/soft/halign.},

We tested the universality of tree species DNA barcodes including rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA and ITS, and examined their abilities of species identification and phylogenetic construction in three tropical cloud forests. Results showed that the success rates of PCR amplification of rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA and ITS were 75.26\% ± 3.65\%, 57.24\% ± 4.42\%, 79.28\% ± 7.08\%, 50.31\% ± 6.64\%, and the rates of DNA sequencing were 63.84\% ± 4.32\%, 50.82\% ± 4.36\%, 72.87\% ± 11.37\%, 45.15\% ± 8.91\% respectively, suggesting that both rbcL and trnH-psbA are universal for tree species in the tropical cloud forests. The success rates of species identification of the four fragments were higher than 41.00\% (rbcL: 41.50\% ± 2.81\%, matK: 42.88\% ± 2.59\%, trnH-psbA: 46.16\% ± 5.11\% and ITS: 47.20\% ± 5.76\%), demonstrating that these fragments have potentiality in species identification. When the phylogenetic relationships were built with random fragment combinations, optimal evolutionary tree with high supporting values were established using the combinations of rbcL + matK + trnH-psbA in tropical cloud forests.},

	abstract = {Because many animal species are undescribed, and because the identification of known species is often difficult, interim taxonomic nomenclature has often been used in biodiversity analysis. By assigning individuals to presumptive species, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), these systems speed investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have conventionally been separated through their morphological divergence, DNA-based delineations are not only feasible, but have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated, data can be readily archived, and results can be easily compared among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to develop a persistent, species-level taxonomic registry for the animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. It begins by examining the correspondence between groups of specimens identified to a species through prior taxonomic work and those inferred from the analysis of COI sequence variation using one new (RESL) and four established (ABGD, CROP, GMYC, jMOTU) algorithms. It subsequently describes the implementation, and structural attributes of the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Aside from a pragmatic role in biodiversity assessments, BINs will aid revisionary taxonomy by flagging possible cases of synonymy, and by collating geographical information, descriptive metadata, and images for specimens that are likely to belong to the same species, even if it is undescribed. More than 274,000 BIN web pages are now available, creating a biodiversity resource that is positioned for rapid growth.},

First, we demonstrate that COI profiles, derived from the low-density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species-level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive COI profiles. A model COI profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100\% successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens.

The results indicate that sequence divergences at COI regularly enable the discrimination of closely allied species in all animal phyla except the Cnidaria.

	abstract = {Understanding the factors that contribute to the formation of population genetic structure is a central goal of phylogeographic research, but achieving this goal can be complicated by the stochastic variance inherent to genetic processes. Statistical approaches to testing phylogeographic hypotheses accommodate this stochasticity by evaluating competing models of putative historical population structure, often by simulating null distributions of the expected variance. The effectiveness of these tests depends on the biological realism of the models. Information from the fossil record can aid in reconstructing the historical distributions of some taxa. However, for the majority of taxa, which lack sufficient fossils, paleodistributional modeling can provide valuable spatial-geographic data concerning ancestral distributions. Paleodistributional models are generated by projecting ecological niche models, which predict the current distribution of each species, onto a model of past climatic conditions. Here, we generate paleodistributional models describing the suitable habitat during the last glacial maximum for lineages from the mesic forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America, and use these models to generate alternative phylogeographic hypotheses. Coalescent simulations are then used to test these hypotheses to improve our understanding of the historical events that promoted the formation of population genetic structure in this ecosystem. Results from Pacific Northwest mesic forest organisms demonstrate the utility of these combined approaches. Paleodistribution models and population genetic structure are congruent across three amphibian lineages, suggesting that they have responded in a concerted manner to environmental change. Two other species, a willow and a water vole, despite being currently codistributed and having similar population genetic structure, were predicted by the paleodistributional model to have had markedly different distributions during the last glacial maximum. This suggests that congruent phylogeographic patterns can arise from incongruent ancestral distributions. Paleodistributional models introduce a much-needed spatial-geographic perspective to statistical phylogeography. In conjunction with coalescent models of population genetic structure, they have the potential to improve our understanding of the factors that promote population divergence and ultimately produce regional patterns of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Phylogeography, and its extensions into comparative phylogeography, have their roots in the layering of gene trees across geography, a paradigm that was greatly facilitated by the nonrecombining, fast evolution provided by animal mtDNA. As phylogeography moves into the era of next-generation sequencing, the specter of reticulation at several levels—within loci and genomes in the form of recombination and across populations and species in the form of introgression—has raised its head with a prominence even greater than glimpsed during the nuclear gene PCR era. Here we explore the theme of reticulation in comparative phylogeography, speciation analysis, and phylogenomics, and ask how the centrality of gene trees has fared in the next-generation era. To frame these issues, we first provide a snapshot of multilocus phylogeographic studies across the Carpentarian Barrier, a prominent biogeographic barrier dividing faunas spanning the monsoon tropics in northern Australia. We find that divergence across this barrier is evident in most species, but is heterogeneous in time and demographic history, often reflecting the taxonomic distinctness of lineages spanning it. We then discuss a variety of forces generating reticulate patterns in phylogeography, including introgression, contact zones, and the potential selection-driven outliers on next-generation molecular markers. We emphasize the continued need for demographic models incorporating reticulation at the level of genomes and populations, and conclude that gene trees, whether explicit or implicit, should continue to play a role in the future of phylogeography.},

	abstract = {A challenge to understanding biological diversification is accounting for community-scale processes that cause multiple, co-distributed lineages to co-speciate. Such processes predict non-independent, temporally clustered divergences across taxa. Approximate-likelihood Bayesian computation (ABC) approaches to inferring such patterns from comparative genetic data are very sensitive to prior assumptions and often biased toward estimating shared divergences. We introduce a full-likelihood Bayesian approach, ecoevolity, which takes full advantage of information in genomic data. By analytically integrating over gene trees, we are able to directly calculate the likelihood of the population history from genomic data, and efficiently sample the model-averaged posterior via Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Using simulations, we find that the new method is much more accurate and precise at estimating the number and timing of divergence events across pairs of populations than existing approximate-likelihood methods. Our full Bayesian approach also requires several orders of magnitude less computational time than existing ABC approaches. We find that despite assuming unlinked characters (e.g., unlinked single-nucleotide polymorphisms), the new method performs better if this assumption is violated in order to retain the constant characters of whole linked loci. In fact, retaining constant characters allows the new method to robustly estimate the correct number of divergence events with high posterior probability in the face of character-acquisition biases, which commonly plague loci assembled from reduced-representation genomic libraries. We apply our method to genomic data from four pairs of insular populations of Gekko lizards from the Philippines that are not expected to have co-diverged. Despite all four pairs diverging very recently, our method strongly supports that they diverged independently, and these results are robust to very disparate prior assumptions.},

	abstract = {The study of demographic processes involved in species diversification and evolution ultimately provides explanations for the complex distribution of biodiversity on earth, indicates regions important for the maintenance and generation of biodiversity, and identifies biological units important for conservation or medical consequence. African and forest biota have both received relatively little attention with regard to understanding their diversification, although one possible mechanism is that this has been driven by historical climate change. To investigate this, we implemented a standard population genetics approach along with Approximate Bayesian Computation, using sequence data from two exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) nuclear loci and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I, to investigate the evolutionary history of five medically important and inherently forest dependent mosquito species of the genus Aedes. By testing different demographic hypotheses, we show that Aedes bromeliae and Aedes lilii fit the same model of lineage diversification, admixture, expansion, and recent population structure previously inferred for Aedes aegypti. In addition, analyses of population structure show that Aedes africanus has undergone lineage diversification and expansion while Aedes hansfordi has been impacted by population expansion within Uganda. This congruence in evolutionary history is likely to relate to historical climate-driven habitat change within Africa during the late Pleistocene and Holocene epoch. We find differences in the population structure of mosquitoes from Tanzania and Uganda compared to Benin and Uganda which could relate to differences in the historical connectivity of forests across the continent. Our findings emphasize the importance of recent climate change in the evolution of African forest biota.},

Ever since its inception in the late 1970s (11, 12) and mid-1980s (13), the field has sought to extend phylogenetic reasoning to the intraspecific level, and thereby build empirical and conceptual bridges between the formerly separate disciplines of microevolutionary population genetics and macroevolutionary phylogenetics. In the early years, phylogeographers relied on data from restriction-site surveys of mitochondrial (mt) DNA to draw inferences about population structure and historical demography, but stunning improvements in molecular techniques (14, 15) and extensions of coalescent theory and other analytical methods (16) later broadened the field’s scope dramatically (17). Phylogeographic perspectives have transformed aspects of population biology, biogeography, systematics, ecology, genetics, and biodiversity conservation. One aim of this colloquium was to bring together leading scientists to address the current state of phylogeography as the discipline enters its fourth decade. The broader goal was to update a wide audience on recent developments in phylogeographic research and their relevance to past accomplishments and future research directions.

Many of the advancements in phylogeography have entailed comparative appraisals of one sort or another (18). (See refs. 1⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–9 for papers from previous colloquia in the series and Box 1 for an overview of the series.) Papers in Section I of this colloquium emphasize the word “comparative” in a spatial sense, where the phylogeographic assessments entail various species (sometimes generally codistributed) that may be representative of particular kinds of environmental settings, such as oceanic versus continental realms. Section II deals with comparative phylogeography in a genomic sense. Nonrecombining cytoplasmic genomes have been the standard workhorses of genealogical analyses, but in principle the primary library of evolutionary histories is ensconced …

	abstract = {Several authors have argued recently that extensive taxon sampling has a positive and important effect on the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates. However, other authors have argued that there is little benefit of extensive taxon sampling, and so phylogenetic problems can or should be reduced to a few exemplar taxa as a means of reducing the computational complexity of the phylogenetic analysis. In this paper we examined five aspects of study design that may have led to these different perspectives. First, we considered the measurement of phylogenetic error across a wide range of taxon sample sizes, and conclude that the expected error based on randomly selecting trees (which varies by taxon sample size) must be considered in evaluating error in studies of the effects of taxon sampling. Second, we addressed the scope of the phylogenetic problems defined by different samples of taxa, and argue that phylogenetic scope needs to be considered in evaluating the importance of taxon-sampling strategies. Third, we examined the claim that fast and simple tree searches are as effective as more thorough searches at finding near-optimal trees that minimize error. We show that a more complete search of tree space reduces phylogenetic error, especially as the taxon sample size increases. Fourth, we examined the effects of simple versus complex simulation models on taxonomic sampling studies. Although benefits of taxon sampling are apparent for all models, data generated under more complex models of evolution produce higher overall levels of error and show greater positive effects of increased taxon sampling. Fifth, we asked if different phylogenetic optimality criteria show different effects of taxon sampling. Although we found strong differences in effectiveness of different optimality criteria as a function of taxon sample size, increased taxon sampling improved the results from all the common optimality criteria. Nonetheless, the method that showed the lowest overall performance (minimum evolution) also showed the least improvement from increased taxon sampling. Taking each of these results into account re-enforces the conclusion that increased sampling of taxa is one of the most important ways to increase overall phylogenetic accuracy.},

The length of the sequences is 709bp with the content of A+T (67.7\%) greater than that of G+C (32.3\%).

In addition, we obtained 42 haplotypes, 4 (9.52\%) of which are shared among different populations. The haplotype diversity of Aedes albopictus is 0.882 and nucleotide diversity is 0.01017. Moreover, the pedigree network diagram shows that most haplotypes are under parallel evolution, suggesting a local expansion of Aedes albopictus in history. Finally, the Neighbor-Joining tree of MT-COI haplotypes reveals a certain correlation between haplotype clusters and geographical distribution, and there are differences among Aedes albopictus in different geographical regions.

Gene trees are components of population trees or species trees; their analysis entails a shift in perspective from many of the familiar models and concepts of population genetics, which typically deal with frequencies of phylogenetically unordered alleles. Molecular surveys of haplotype diversity in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have provided the first extensive empirical data suitable for estimation of gene trees on a microevolutionary (intraspecific) scale. The relationship between phylogeny and geographic distribution constitutes the phylogeographic pattern for any species. Observed phylogeographic trees can be interpreted in terms of historical demography by comparison to predictions derived from models of gene lineage sorting, such as inbreeding theory and branching-process theory. Results of such analyses for more than 20 vertebrate species strongly suggest that the demographies of populations have been remarkably dynamic and unsettled over space and recent evolutionary time. This conclusion is consistent with ecological observations documenting dramatic population-size fluctuations and range shifts in many contemporary species. By adding an historical perspective to population biology, the gene-lineage approach can help forge links between the disciplines of phylogenetic systematics (and macroevolutionary study) and population genetics (microevolution). Preliminary extensions of the "gene tree" methodology to haplotypes of nuclear genes (such as Adh in Drosophila melanogaster) demonstrate that the phylogenetic perspective can also help to illuminate molecular-genetic processes (such as recombination or gene conversion), as well as contribute to knowledge of the origin, age, and molecular basis of particular adaptations.},

Homoplasic molecular data are phylogenetically ambiguous. Converting homoplasic molecular data into a tree represents an extrapolation, and there can be myriad candidate trees among which to choose. Derivative biogeographic analyses of ‘the tree’ are analyses of that extrapolation, and the results depend on the tree chosen. I explore the informational aspects of converting a multicharacter data set into a phylogenetic tree, and then explore what happens when that tree is used for population analysis. Three conclusions follow: (i) some trees are better than others; good trees are true to the data, whereas bad trees are not; (ii) for biogeographic analysis, we should use only good trees, which yield the same biogeographic inference as the phenetic data, but little more; and (iii) the reliable biogeographic inference is inherent in the phenetic data, not the trees.},

	abstract = {The Hawaiian archipelago is arguably the world’s finest natural laboratory for the study of evolution and patterns of speciation. Arthropods comprise over 75\% of the endemic biota of the Hawaiian Islands and a large proportion belongs to species radiations. We classify patterns of speciation within Hawaiian arthropod lineages into three categories: (i) single representatives of a lineage throughout the islands; (ii) species radiations with either (a) single endemic species on different volcanoes or islands, or (b) multiple species on each volcano or island; and (iii) single widespread species within a radiation of species that exhibits local endemism. A common pattern of phylogeography is that of repeated colonization of new island groups, such that lineages progress down the island chain, with the most ancestral groups (populations or species) on the oldest islands. While great dispersal ability and its subsequent loss are features of many of these taxa, there are a number of mechanisms that underlie diversification. These mechanisms may be genetic, including repeated founder events, hybridization, and sexual selection, or ecological, including shifts in habitat and/or host affiliation. The majority of studies reviewed suggest that natural selection is a primary force of change during the initial diversification of taxa.},

We use this approach to define species boundaries, based minimally on the principle of reciprocal monophyly, in conjunction with morphological or other genetic discontinuities.

We relate patterns of concordant geographical shifts with underlying tectonic history and to current positions of major rivers. Finally, we provide comments on the utility of these data and patterns to conservation, articulating a need to incorporate phylogeographic information as part of the rationale in establishing conservation priorities at the organismal and geographical area levels.},

Thirty years ago, the approach now known as comparative phylogeography was introduced in a landmark study of a continental biota. Here, I use a set of 455 studies to explore the current scope of continental comparative phylogeography, including geographic, conceptual, temporal, ecological, and genomic attributes. Geographically, studies are more frequent in the northern hemisphere, but the south is catching up. Most studies focus on a Quaternary timeframe, but the Neogene is well represented. As such, explanations for geographic structure and history include geological and climatic events in Earth history, and responses include vicariance, dispersal, and range contraction-expansion into and out of refugia. Focal taxa are biased toward terrestrial or semiterrestrial vertebrates, although plants and invertebrates are well represented in some regions. The use of various kinds of nuclear DNA markers is increasing, as are multiple locus studies, but use of organelle DNA is not decreasing. Species distribution models are not yet widely incorporated into studies. In the future, continental comparative phylogeographers will continue to contribute to erosion of the simple vicariance vs. dispersal paradigm, including exposure of the widespread nature of temporal pseudocongruence and its implications for models of diversification; provide new templates for addressing a variety of ecological and evolutionary traits; and develop closer working relationships with earth scientists and biologists in a variety of disciplines.},

Here, we present a model-based framework for comparative phylogeography. Our framework was initially developed for statistical phylogeography based on a multi-model inference approach, by coupling ecological niche modeling, coalescent simulation and direct spatio-temporal reconstruction of lineage diffusion using a relaxed random walk model. This multi-model inference framework is particularly useful to investigate the complex dynamics and current patterns in genetic diversity in response to processes operating on multiple taxonomic levels in comparative phylogeography. In addition, because of the lack, or incompleteness of fossil record, the understanding of the role of biogeographical events (vicariance and dispersal routes) in most regions worldwide is barely known. Thus, we believe that the expansion of that framework for multiple species under a comparative approach may give clues on genetic legacies in response to Quaternary climate changes and other biogeographical processes.},

The new field was termed phylogeography. Since the naming of the field, the statistical rigor of phylogeography has increased, in large part due to concurrent advances in coalescent theory which enabled model-based parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. The next phase will involve phylogeography increasingly becoming the integrative and comparative multi-taxon endeavor that it was originally conceived to be. This exciting convergence will likely involve combining spatially-explicit multiple taxon coalescent models, genomic studies of natural selection, ecological niche modeling, studies of ecological speciation, community assembly and functional trait evolution. This ambitious synthesis will allow us to determine the causal links between geography, climate change, ecological interactions and the evolution and composition of taxa across whole communities and assemblages. Although such integration presents analytical and computational challenges that will only be intensified by the growth of genomic data in non-model taxa, the rapid development of “likelihood-free” approximate Bayesian methods should permit parameter estimation and hypotheses testing using complex evolutionary demographic models and genomic phylogeographic data. We first review the conceptual beginnings of phylogeography and its accomplishments and then illustrate how it evolved into a statistically rigorous enterprise with the concurrent rise of coalescent theory. Subsequently, we discuss ways in which model-based phylogeography can interface with various subfields to become one of the most integrative fields in all of ecology and evolutionary biology.},

Methods As an example, using narrative and best evidence synthesis, I re-evaluate ad hoc aggregate analyses relating population genetic structure (FST) to dispersal potential. I deconstruct an aggregate global analysis to generate a regional subset of data which I compare with datasets describing co-distributed taxa, SDC species and sympatric sister species. Results A weak negative relationship between FST and dispersal potential is implied by aggregate global analysis (0.1 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.29). In contrast, regional datasets of co-distributed species show strong correlation between FST and dispersal potential (0.78 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.85). Comparisons between SDC and sympatric sister species consistently evince higher gene flow in species with higher dispersal potential. Main conclusions Ad hoc aggregate analyses can be compromised by multiple sources of error. Comparisons of SDC taxa, including sympatric sister species, adapt the experimental scientific method to natural situations, providing robust and repeatable tests of phylogeographic hypotheses and accurate estimates of effect sizes. To make strong inferences about phylogeography we should seek out the hidden wealth of natural experiments that provide particularly clear opportunities to study the factors that influence patterns of biodiversity. The SDC framework enables independent tests of existing hypotheses, integration of independent studies in meta-analyses across taxa and regions, and identification of general trends versus location- or taxon-specific phenomena. Coupled with advances in statistical phylogeography, species distribution modelling and palaeoecology, the SDC framework bridges the long-standing gap between observational and experimental sciences.},

Despite the utility of comparative phylogeography for uncovering such ‘cryptic vicariance’, this approach has yet to be embraced by some researchers as a valuable complement to other approaches to historical biogeography. We address here some of the common misconceptions surrounding comparative phylogeography, provide an example of this approach based on the boreal mammal fauna of North America, and argue that together with other approaches, comparative phylogeography can contribute importantly to our understanding of the relationship between earth history and biotic diversification.},

An effective approach to such studies would involve automatic retrieval of georeferenced sequence data from nucleotide databases (a first step towards an ‘automated phylogeography’). It remains unclear if, despite repeated calls, georeferencing of nucleotide databases has increased in frequency, and if accumulated data allow for broad applications based on automated retrieval of sequence data and associated geographical information. Here, we investigated geographical information available in NCBI GenBank accessions for tetrapods, exploring temporal and geographical patterns in georeferencing, and quantifying data available for automated phylogeography. Location Global. Methods We developed Python and R scripts to (1) download metadata from GenBank (1,125,514 accessions, {\textgreater} 20,000 species); (2) geocode accessions from associated metadata; (3) map originally georeferenced and geocoded accessions and plot their frequency against time; (4) assess the size of intraspecific sets of homologous sequences and compare their geographical extent with species ranges, thus evaluating their potential for phylogeographical analyses. Results Only 6.2\% of surveyed tetrapod GenBank submissions reported geographical coordinates, without increase in recent years. Our geocoding raised georeferenced accessions to 15.1\%. The geographical distribution of georeferenced accessions is patchy, and especially sparse in economically underdeveloped areas. Automatically retrievable informative data sets covering most of the range are available for very few species of wide-ranging tetrapods. Main conclusions Although geocoding offers a partial solution to the scarcity of direct georeferencing, the amount of data potentially useful for automated phylogeography is still limited. Strong underrepresentation of hard-to-access areas suggests that sampling logistics represent a main hindrance to global data availability. We propose that, besides enhancing georeferencing of genetic data, future research agendas should focus on collaborative efforts to sample genetic diversity in biodiversity-rich tropical areas.},

	abstract = {Animal mitochondrial DNA is characterized by a remarkably high level of within-species homoplasy, that is, phylogenetic incongruence between sites of the molecule. Several investigators have invoked recombination to explain it, challenging the dogma of maternal, clonal mitochondrial inheritance in animals. Alternatively, a high level of homoplasy could be explained by the existence of mutation hot spots. By using an exhaustive mammalian data set, we test the hot spot hypothesis by comparing patterns of site-specific polymorphism and divergence in several groups of closely related species, including hominids. We detect significant co-occurrence of synonymous polymorphisms among closely related species in various mammalian groups, and a correlation between the site-specific levels of variability within humans (on one hand) and between Hominoidea species (on the other hand), indicating that mutation hot spots actually exist in mammalian mitochondrial coding regions. The whole data, however, cannot be explained by a simple mutation hot spots model. Rather, we show that the site-specific mutation rate quickly varies in time, so that the same sites are not hypermutable in distinct lineages. This study provides a plausible mutation model that potentially accounts for the peculiar distribution of mitochondrial sequence variation in mammals without the need for invoking recombination. It also gives hints about the proximal causes of mitochondrial site-specific hypermutability in humans.},

Fragments of this gene are often used to infer phylogenies, particularly the region near the 5'-end, which is used by the DNA Barcoding Consortium. With a growing number of sequences being deposited in the DNA barcoding database, there is an urgent need to understand the evolution of this gene and its evolutionary relationship among species; it is also important to analyze the informative potential of the gene for phylogenetic inferences for each group used. In this study, the COI gene was divided into three distinct regions: a 5'-region, a central region, and a 3'-region. The nucleotide composition of these regions was analyzed, and their potential for making informative phylogenetic inferences using species in the families Coreidae and Pentatomidae (Heteroptera) was assessed. It was found that the same region in the COI gene may present different behaviors for each family analyzed, and that using additional regions from the same gene may even prejudice the analysis.},

However, our understanding of patterns of molecular evolution within these genes is limited. Here we examine patterns of nucleotide divergence in COI–COII within species and between species pairs of Lepidoptera and Diptera using a sliding window analysis. We found that: (1) locations of maximum divergence within COI–COII were highly variable among taxa surveyed in this study; (2) there was major overlap in divergence within versus between species, including within individual COI–COII profiles; (3) graphical DNA saturation analysis showed variation in percent nucleotide transitions throughout COI–COII and only limited association with levels of DNA divergence. Ultimately, no single optimally informative 600 bp location was found within the 2.3kb of COI–COII, and the DNA barcoding region was no better than other regions downstream in COI. Consequently, we recommend that researchers should maximize sequence length to increase the probability of sampling regions of high phylogenetic informativeness, and to minimize stochastic variation in estimating total divergence.},

We have sequenced 2.3 kb of DNA from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and II genes (COI and COII) for 23 Papilio taxa and two outgroups, Pachliopta neptunus and Eurytides marcellus, in order to assess the potential of these genes for use in Papilio phylogenetics and to examine patterns of gene evolution across a broad taxonomic range. Nucleotide and amino acid variation is distributed heterogeneously, both within and between genes. Structural features of the proteins are not always reliable predictors of variation. In a combined analysis, these sequences support a nearly fully resolved topology within subgenera and species groups, though higher level relationships among species groups require additional study. The most noteworthy findings are that neither Papilio alexanor nor P. xuthus belongs in the machaon group and that the subgenus Pterourus is paraphyletic with respect to the subgenus Pyrrhosticta. We leave relationships among members of the phorcas species group as a trichotomy. These two protein coding genes, particularly COI, show excellent performance in resolving relationships at the level of species and species groups among Papilionidae. We strongly endorse a similar approach for future studies aimed at these levels.},

In this context, utility of different nuclear encoded genes (like 16S rRNA, 5S rRNA, 28S rRNA) mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase, mitochondrial 12S, cytochrome b, control region) and few chloroplast encoded genes (like rbcL, matK, rpl16) are discussed. Criteria for choosing suitable molecular markers and steps leading to the construction of phylogenetic trees have been discussed. Although widely practised even now, traditional morphology based systems of classification of organisms have some limitations. On the other hand it appears that the use of molecular markers, though relatively recent in popularity and are not free entirely of flaws, can complement the traditional morphology based method for phylogenetic studies.},

In this study, we investigate whether two observed COI haplogroups in the earthworm Aporrectodea longa correspond to two cryptic species or if the variation is intraspecific. This is done by complementing COI with two nuclear markers, ITS2 and Histone 3. The variation is studied using distance methods, parsimony networks and Bayesian coalescent trees, and the statistical distinctness of the groups is tested on gene trees using the genealogical sorting index, Rosenberg’s PAB and Rodrigo et al.’s P(RD). We also applied multilocus species delimitation based on the multispecies coalescence model. The two haplogroups were found in COI, and all tests except P(RD) found them to be significantly distinct. However, in ITS2, the same groups were not recovered in any analyses or tests. H3 was invariable in A. longa, and was, therefore, included only in the multilocus analysis, which preferred a model treating A. longa as one species over a model splitting it into two. We also compared two measurements of size, body length, and no. of segments between the groups. No difference in body length was found, and although a significant difference in no. of segments was noted the haplogroup with the lower mean showed both the highest and the lowest value. When combined, these results led us to the conclusion that there is no support for the separation of A. longa into two cryptic species. This study again highlights the importance of complementing mitochondrial barcodes with more data when establishing species boundaries.},

	abstract = {The utility of hydropsychid (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae) caddisfly larvae for freshwater biomonitoring has been demonstrated, but the major impediment to its implementation has been the lack of species-level larval descriptions and illustrations. A rapid and reliable molecular protocol that also uses morphology is proposed because conventional approaches to associating undescribed larvae with adults have been slow and problematic. Male adults were identified before DNA sequence analyses were used. These identifications established morphospecies boundaries that were mapped on phylograms constructed from 2 independent gene fragments: mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and large subunit (28S) nuclear ribosomal DNA expansion fragment D2 (D2). Species boundaries were confirmed if they were monophyletic on both molecular phylograms. Larval associations were made with reference to the phylogenetic analyses under 2 criteria: sequence identity across both genes or nested placement within a reference species boundary. A total of 133 individuals belonging to Chinese Hydropsyche sensu lato group (including Hydropsyche [Hydropsyche], Hydropsyche [Occutanspsyche], Ceratopsyche, Mexipsyche, Hydatomanicus, and Herbertorossia) were included in our study to test the new protocol. D2 sequences (all individuals) and COI sequences (101 individuals) were obtained, and 2 independent phylograms were constructed using neighbor joining. Both fragments provided enough nucleotide changes to differentiate independently most Hydropsyche sensu lato species, with ambiguity in only a few species that eventually could be resolved with additional sequences and specimens. COI diverges significantly within some species, suggesting a need for caution when applying typical genetic divergence thresholds in species diagnoses. The study enabled us to establish a procedure for delimiting species boundaries and associating larvae and adults using DNA sequences and morphological evidence. Ideal sampling strategies for larval–adult association are suggested. Associating larvae and adults of hydropsychids using DNA sequences appears to be promising in terms of both reliability and speed.},

	abstract = {Trichoptera are holometabolous insects with aquatic larvae that, together with the Lepidoptera, make up the Amphiesmenoptera. Despite extensive previous morphological work, little phylogenetic agreement has been reached about the relationship among the three suborders--Annulipalpia, Spicipalpia, and Integripalpia--or about the monophyly of Spicipalpia. In an effort to resolve this conflict, we sequenced fragments of the large and small subunit nuclear ribosomal RNAs (1078 nt; D1, D3, V4-5), the nuclear elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EF-1 alpha; 1098 nt), and a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI; 411 nt). Seventy adult and larval morphological characters were reanalyzed and added to molecular data in a combined analysis. We evaluated signal and homoplasy in each of the molecular datasets and attempted to rank the particular datasets according to how appropriate they were for inferring relationships among suborders. This evaluation included testing for conflict among datasets, comparing tree lengths among alternative hypotheses, measuring the left-skew of tree-length distributions from maximally divergent sets of taxa, evaluating the recovery of expected clades, visualizing whether or not substitutions were accumulating with time, and estimating nucleotide compositional bias. Although all these measures cast doubt on the reliability of the deep-level signal coming from the nucleotides of the COI and EF-1 alpha genes, these data could still be included in combined analyses without overturning the results from the most conservative marker, the rRNA. The different datasets were found to be evolving under extremely different rates. A site-specific likelihood method for dealing with combined data with nonoverlapping parameters was proposed, and a similar weighting scheme under parsimony was evaluated. Among our phylogenetic conclusions, we found Annulipalpia to be the most basal of the three suborders, with Spicipalpia and Integripalpia forming a clade. Monophyly of Annulipalpia and Integripalpia was confirmed, but the relationships among spicipalpians remain equivocal.},

High gene flow together with a recent and sudden population expansion characterise the genetic population structure of this species. No geographically induced differentiation was observed, nor were subspecies identified as separate evolutionary units. The discrepancy between the genetic and ecological variation is most likely due to the slower rate of mtDNA evolution compared to ecological differentiation. The control region proved to be a less useful molecular marker for the population genetics and the phylogenetic reconstruction of closely related taxa in A. urticae than it has for other species. The extreme bias in adenine and thymine content (A+T=90.91\%) probably renders this region highly susceptible to homoplasy, resulting in a less informative molecular marker.},

	abstract = {We analyzed 12 combined mitochondrial and nuclear gene datasets in seven orders of insects using both equal weights parsimony (to evaluate phylogenetic utility) and Bayesian methods (to investigate substitution patterns). For the Bayesian analyses we used relatively complex models (e.g., general time reversible models with rate variation) that allowed us to quantitatively compare relative rates among genes and codon positions, patterns of rate variation among genes, and substitution patterns within genes. Our analyses indicate that nuclear and mitochondrial genes differ in a number of important ways, some of which are correlated with phylogenetic utility. First and most obviously, nuclear genes generally evolve more slowly than mitochondrial genes (except in one case), making them better markers for deep divergences. Second, nuclear genes showed universally high values of CI and (generally) contribute more to overall tree resolution than mitochondrial genes (as measured by partitioned Bremer support). Third, nuclear genes show more homogeneous patterns of among-site rate variation (higher values of α than mitochondrial genes). Finally, nuclear genes show more symmetrical transformation rate matrices than mitochondrial genes. The combination of low values of α and highly asymmetrical transformation rate matrices may explain the overall poor performance of mitochondrial genes when compared to nuclear genes in the same analysis. Our analyses indicate that some parameters are highly correlated. For example, A/T bias was positively and significantly associated with relative rate and CI was positively and significantly associated with α (the shape of the gamma distribution). These results provide important insights into the substitution patterns that might characterized high quality genes for phylogenetic analysis: high values of α, unbiased base composition, and symmetrical transformation rate matrices. We argue that insect molecular systematists should increasingly focus on nuclear rather than mitochondrial gene datasets because nuclear genes do not suffer from the same substitutional biases that characterize mitochondrial genes.},

We examined the pattern of genetic variation across the range of this species to explore its demographic history and its phylogeographic pattern. Analysis of the mtDNA sequences of 173 individuals from 25 Mexican populations allowed to us identify 53 geographically structured haplotypes. High haplotype and low nucleotide diversities and Tajima’s D indicate that D. mexicanus experienced rapid population expansion during its dispersal across mountain systems within its current range. The nested clade phylogeographic analysis indicates that the phylogeographic pattern of D. mexicanus is explained by continuous dispersion among lineages from the Sierra Madre Occidental, the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. However, we also observed isolation events among haplotypes from the Cofre de Perote/Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt/Sierra Madre Oriental and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt/Sierra Madre del Sur, which is consistent with the present conformation of mountain systems in Mexico and the emergence of geographical barriers during the Pleistocene.},

	abstract = {The Falkland biota are generally considered to be derived from the nearest continental source in Patagonian South America, yet they harbor many endemic species whose taxonomy and evolutionary history remains insufficiently understood. Comprehensive sampling of Coleoptera over two field seasons from numerous sites across the Falkland archipelago produced representatives of 55 morphologically separable species, assigned to 35 genera and 13 families of Coleoptera. Partial mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I and 16S ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced for 283 individuals. These sequences formed 55 clusters under a Yule-Coalescent model that largely conformed to Linnean species while deep-level phylogenetic relationships were broadly congruent with the higher level classification. Detailed analysis of the most diverse families Carabidae and Curculionidae addressed the question about the age and persistence in situ of Falkland biota, showing that separation of sister species within genera based on molecular clock estimates pre-dated the Pleistocene in all cases. Intra-specific diversity of mtDNA haplotypes and nucleotide diversity were high in most species, while intra-population variation was equally high and showed local differentiation of populations, but there was no isolation-by-distance relationship. Taken together, these observations indicate that ancient endemics are unlikely to be due to the recent establishment from a source elsewhere, but have persisted in situ. The observed patterns differ greatly from those in climatically similar areas of the Northern Hemisphere. They do not support the view that postglacial ranges of insects near the limits of former glaciations are merely the result of redistribution due to changing climate.},

While this has been well demonstrated for lowland species, less is known about high altitude taxa. Here we analyze the phylogeography of the leaf beetle Oreina elongata from 20 populations across the Alps and Apennines. Three mitochondrial and one nuclear region were sequenced in 64 individuals. Within an mtDNA phylogeny, three of seven subspecies are monophyletic. The species is chemically defended and aposematic, with green and blue forms showing geographic variation and unexpected within-population polymorphism. These warning colors show pronounced east–west geographical structure in distribution, but the phylogeography suggests repeated origin and loss. Basal clades come from the central Alps. Ancestors of other clades probably survived across northern Italy and the northern Adriatic, before separation of eastern, southern and western populations and rapid spread through the western Alps. After reviewing calibrated gene-specific substitution rates in the literature, we use partitioned Bayesian coalescent analysis to date our phylogeography. The major clades diverged long before the last glacial maximum, suggesting that O. elongata persisted many glacial cycles within or at the edges of the Alps and Apennines. When analyzing additional barcoding pairwise distances, we find strong evidence to consider O. elongata as a species complex rather than a single species.},

	abstract = {The family Curculionidae (Coleoptera), the “true” weevils, have diversified tightly linked to the evolution of flowering plants. Here, we aim to assess diversification at a lower taxonomic level. We analyze the evolution of the genus Trichobaris in association with their host plants. Trichobaris comprises eight to thirteen species; their larvae feed inside the fruits of Datura spp. or inside the stem of wild and cultivated species of Solanaceae, such as potato, tobacco and tomato. We ask the following questions: (1) does the rostrum of Trichobaris species evolve according to the plant tissue used to oviposit, i.e., shorter rostrum to dig in stems and longer to dig in fruits? and (2) does Trichobaris diversify mainly in relation to the use of Datura species? For the first question, we estimated the phylogeny of Trichobaris based on four gene sequences (nuclear 18S and 28S rRNA genes and mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI genes). Then, we carried out morphogeometric analyses of the Trichobaris species using 75 landmarks. For the second question, we calibrated a COI haplotype phylogeny using a constant rate of divergence to infer the diversification time of Trichobaris species, and we traced the host plant species on the haplotype network. We performed an ancestral state reconstruction analysis to infer recent colonization events and conserved associations with host plant species. We found that ancestral species in the Trichobaris phylogeny use the stem of Solanum plants for oviposition and display weak sexual dimorphism of rostrum size, whereas other, more recent species of Trichobaris display sexual dimorphism in rostrum size and use the fruits of Datura species, and a possible reversion to use the stem of Solanaceae was detected in one Trichobaris species. The use of Datura species by Trichobaris species is widely distributed on haplotype networks and restricted to Trichobaris species that originated ca. 5 ± 1.5 Ma. Given that the origin of Trichobaris is estimated to be ca. 6 ± 1.5 Ma, it is likely that Datura has played a role in its diversification.},

Despite considerable research using several species of Hydroides as models in ecological and biofouling studies, phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within the genus are still poorly understood. Using combined mitochondrial (COI, cytochrome b) and nuclear (18S, 28S and ITS) gene markers for 284 individuals of 45 morphospecies of Hydroides, we investigated the global phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within the genus. Phylogenetic topologies were well supported and indicated high genetic diversity within Hydroides, revealing potential cryptic species. Present results also include the first COI barcoding data enabling rapid and effective species identification of Hydroides on a global scale. Phylogenetic relationships within Hydroides were more concordant with geographical distributions than morphological similarity of their opercula. Molecular divergence estimates suggested the origin and subsequent diversification in the western Tethys Sea followed by a shift of the historical centre of diversity from the Indo-Mediterranean region to the central Indo-Pacific during the last 50 million years. Further studies on population genetics of species consisting of multiple lineages would provide a better understanding on the status of potential cryptic species. Furthermore, paleogeographic studies based on fossil Hydroides tubes would provide evidence to test this biogeographic hypothesis.},

While coalescent theory bridges across timescales to facilitate this integration, it is important to appreciate the assumptions, caveats, and recent theoretical advances so as to most effectively exploit genomic analysis. Here I outline the connections between population processes and phylogeny, with special attention to how genomic features play into underlying predictions. I discuss empirical and theoretical complications, and solutions, relating to recombination and multifurcating genealogical processes, predictions about how genome structure affects gene tree heterogeneity, and practical choices in genome sequencing and analysis. I illustrate the conceptual implications and practical benefits of how genomic features generate predictable patterns of discordance of gene trees and species trees along genomes, for example, as a consequence of how regions of low recombination and sex linkage interact with natural selection and with the accumulation of reproductive incompatibilities in speciation. Moreover, treating population genetic parameters as characters to be mapped onto phylogenies offers a new way to understand the evolutionary drivers of diversity within and differentiation between populations. Despite a number of challenges conferred by genomic information, the melding of phylogenetics, phylogeography and population genetics into integrative molecular evolution is poised to improve our understanding of biodiversity at all levels.},

We obtained a total of 112 samples from 22 localities, covering the complete distribution of the species. Phylogenetic analyses using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference confirmed that Osgoodomys is a monophyletic group. In addition, phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses detected three major clades, which do not coincide with the recognized subspecies of O. banderanus. The genetic lineages detected are the western clade (Nayarit, Jalisco and northern Colima), the central clade (Colima, Michoacán, and northern Guerrero) and the eastern clade (central and southern Guerrero). Genetic distances among clades (5–9\%) and nucleotide substitutions (30–88) among haplogroups were high, especially in the southern group. Mountain ranges such as the Transmexican Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Madre del Sur, as well as the Balsas River act as geographical barriers for Osgoodomys.

The coconut hispine beetle (CHB), Brontispa longissima (Gestro) is an economically important pest of palm cultivation worldwide. In the present study, we comprehensively surveyed the Wolbachia-infection prevalence and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphism in CHB from five different geographical locations, including China’s Mainland and Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. A total of 540 sequences were screened in this study through three different genes, i.e., cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), Wolbachia outer surface protein (wsp) and multilocus sequencing type (MLST) genes. The COI genetic divergence ranges from 0.08\% to 0.67\%, and likewise, a significant genetic diversity (π = 0.00082; P = 0.049) was noted within and between all analyzed samples. In the meantime, ten different haplotypes (H) were characterized (haplotype diversity = 0.4379) from 21 different locations, and among them, H6 (46 individuals) have shown a maximum number of population clusters than others. Subsequently, Wolbachia-prevalence results indicated that all tested specimens of CHB were found positive (100\%), which suggested that CHB was naturally infected with Wolbachia. Wolbachia sequence results (wsp gene) revealed a high level of nucleotide diversity (π = 0.00047) under Tajima’s D test (P = 0.049). Meanwhile, the same trend of nucleotide diversity (π = 0.00041) was observed in Wolbachia concatenated MLST locus. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis (wsp and concatenated MLST genes) revealed that all collected samples of CHB attributed to same Wolbachia B-supergroup. Our results strongly suggest that Wolbachia bacteria and mtDNA were highly concordant with each other and Wolbachia can affect the genetic structure and diversity within the CHB populations.},

	abstract = {This is a time of unprecedented transition in DNA sequencing technologies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) clearly holds promise for fast and cost-effective generation of multilocus sequence data for phylogeography and phylogenetics. However, the focus on non-model organisms, in addition to uncertainty about which sample preparation methods and analyses are appropriate for different research questions and evolutionary timescales, have contributed to a lag in the application of NGS to these fields. Here, we outline some of the major obstacles specific to the application of NGS to phylogeography and phylogenetics, including the focus on non-model organisms, the necessity of obtaining orthologous loci in a cost-effective manner, and the predominate use of gene trees in these fields. We describe the most promising methods of sample preparation that address these challenges. Methods that reduce the genome by restriction digest and manual size selection are most appropriate for studies at the intraspecific level, whereas methods that target specific genomic regions (i.e., target enrichment or sequence capture) have wider applicability from the population level to deep-level phylogenomics. Additionally, we give an overview of how to analyze NGS data to arrive at data sets applicable to the standard toolkit of phylogeography and phylogenetics, including initial data processing to alignment and genotype calling (both SNPs and loci involving many SNPs). Even though whole-genome sequencing is likely to become affordable rather soon, because phylogeography and phylogenetics rely on analysis of hundreds of individuals in many cases, methods that reduce the genome to a subset of loci should remain more cost-effective for some time to come.},

In this study we use information from two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes and species delimitation methods in order to obtain the first robust time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of the Levantine rock lizards of the genus Phoenicolacerta. We sampled from across its distributional range with the aim to clarify its systematics, biogeography and evolution. Our results suggest that the genus includes two well-supported clades, one comprising solely the montane species Phoenicolacerta kulzeri, and the other including the three remaining species, the relatively widespread, P. laevis, the Syrian-Turkish P. cyanisparsa and the Cypriot endemic P. troodica. We found that both P. laevis and P. cyanisparsa are not monophyletic, as the Turkish populations of P. laevis branch within P. cyanisparsa. We found high levels of undescribed diversity within P. laevis which necessitate a thorough revision. We suggest that Phoenicolacerta started radiating during the mid-late Miocene, and that both vicariance and dispersal events shaped the diversification and distribution of the genus concomitantly with the formation of major geological structures and climatic fluctuations in the Levant. These results highlight the region as an important center of speciation, contributing to the species diversity of the eastern Mediterranean.},

Results indicate that the wide-ranging M. lateralis is composed of at least nine geographically separated and well-supported lineages that represent putative species.

	isbn = {978-0-596-52983-3},
	abstract = {There's nothing that hard-core Unix and Linux users are more fanatical about than their text editor. Editors are the subject of adoration and worship, or of scorn and ridicule, depending upon whether the topic of discussion is your editor or someone else's. vi has been the standard editor for close to 30 years. Popular on Unix and Linux, it has a growing following on Windows systems, too. Most experienced system administrators cite vi as their tool of choice. And since 1986, this book has been the guide for vi. However, Unix systems are not what they were 30 years ago, and neither is this book. While retaining all the valuable features of previous editions, the 7th edition of Learning the vi and vim Editors has been expanded to include detailed information on vim, the leading vi clone. vim is the default version of vi on most Linux systems and on Mac OS X, and is available for many other operating systems too. With this guide, you learn text editing basics and advanced tools for both editors, such as multi-window editing, how to write both interactive macros and scripts to extend the editor, and power tools for programmers -- all in the easy-to-follow style that has made this book a classic. Learning the vi and vim Editors includes: A complete introduction to text editing with vi: How to move around vi in a hurryBeyond the basics, such as using buffersvi's global search and replacementAdvanced editing, including customizing vi and executing Unix commands How to make full use of vim:Extended text objects and more powerful regular expressionsMulti-window editing and powerful vim scriptsHow to make full use of the GUI version of vim, called gvimvim's enhancements for programmers, such as syntax highlighting, folding and extended tags Coverage of three other popular vi clones -- nvi, elvis, and vile -- is also included. You'll find several valuable appendixes, including an alphabetical quick reference to both vi and ex mode commands for regular vi and for vim, plus an updated appendix on vi and the Internet. Learning either vi or vim is required knowledge if you use Linux or Unix, and in either case, reading this book is essential. After reading this book, the choice of editor will be obvious for you too.},

	abstract = {The insect order Trichoptera (caddisflies) forms the second most species-rich monophyletic group of animals in freshwater. So far, several attempts have been made to elucidate its evolutionary history with both morphological and molecular data. However, none have attempted to analyse the time frame for its diversification. The order is divided into three suborders – Annulipalpia, Integripalpia and ‘Spicipalpia’. Historically, the most problematic taxon to place within the order is ‘Spicipalpia’, whose larvae do not build traditional cases or filtering nets like the majority of the caddisflies. They have previously been proposed to be the sister group of all other Trichoptera or more advanced within the order, with equivocal monophyly and with different interordinal placements among various studies. In order to resolve the evolutionary history of the caddisflies as well as timing their diversification, we utilized fragments of three nuclear (carbamoylphosphate synthethase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and RNA polymerase II) and one mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) protein coding genes, with 16 fossil trichopteran taxa used for time calibration. The ‘spicipalpian’ families are recovered as ancestral to all other caddisflies, though paraphyletic. We recover stable relationships among most families and superfamilies, resolving many previously unrecognized phylogenetic affinities amongst extant families. The origin of Trichoptera is estimated to be around 234 Ma, i.e. Middle – Late Triassic.},

Previous cytogenetic study in Thailand revealed that this species is a species complex composed of two cytoforms (A and B). In this study, we cytologically examined specimens obtained from the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, and Puncak, Java, Indonesia. The results revealed two additional cytoforms (C and D) of S. feuerborni. Specimens from Malaysia represent cytoform C, differentiated from other cytoforms by a fixed chromosome inversion on the long arm of chromosome III (IIIL-5). High frequencies of the B chromosome (33-83\%) were also observed in this cytoform. Specimens from Indonesia represent the cytoform D. This cytoform is differentiated from others by a fixed chromosome inversion difference on the long arm of chromosome II (IIL-4). Mitochondrial DNA sequences support genetic differentiation among cytoforms A, B, and C. The pairwise F(ST) values among these cytoforms were highly significantly consistent with the divergent lineages of the cytoforms in a median-joining haplotype network. However, a lack of the sympatric populations prevented us from testing the species status of the cytoforms.},

	volume = {3936},
	abstract = {Although correct taxonomy is paramount for disease control programs and epidemiological studies, morphology-based taxonomy of black flies is extremely difficult. In the present study, the utility of a partial sequence of the COI gene, the DNA barcoding region, for the identification of species of black flies from Mesoamerica was assessed. A total of 32 mor-phospecies were analyzed, one belonging to the genus Gigantodax and 31 species to the genus Simulium and six of its subgenera (Aspathia, Eusimulium, Notolepria, Psaroniocompsa, Psilopelmia, Trichodagmia). The Neighbour Joining tree (NJ) derived from the DNA barcodes grouped most specimens according to species or species groups recognized by mor-photaxonomic studies. Intraspecific sequence divergences within morphologically distinct species ranged from 0.07\% to 1.65\%, while higher divergences (2.05\%–6.13\%) in species complexes suggested the presence of cryptic diversity. The existence of well-defined groups within S. callidum (Dyar \& Shannon), S. quadrivittatum Loew, and S. samboni Jennings revealed the likely inclusion of cryptic species within these taxa. In addition, the suspected presence of sibling species within S. paynei Vargas and S. tarsatum Macquart was supported. DNA barcodes also showed that specimens of species that are difficult to delimit morphologically such as S. callidum, S. pseudocallidum Díaz Nájera, S. travisi Vargas, Vargas \& Ramírez-Pérez, relatives of the species complexes such as S. metallicum Bellardi s.l. (e.g., S. horacioi Okazawa \& On-ishi, S. jobbinsi Vargas, Martínez Palacios, Díaz Nájera, and S. puigi Vargas, Martínez Palacios \& Díaz Nájera), and S. virgatum Coquillett complex (e.g., S. paynei and S. tarsatum) grouped together in the NJ analysis, suggesting they represent valid species. DNA barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provided an effective approach for the identification of medically important black flies species in Mesoamerica and for the discovery of hidden diversity within this group.},

In this study, we used mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcoding sequences to test the efficiency of species identification for the human-biting black flies in Thailand. We used human-biting specimens because they enabled us to link information with previous studies involving the immature stages. Three black fly taxa, Simulium nodosum, S. nigrogilvum and S. doipuiense complex, were collected. The S. doipuiense complex was confirmed for the first time as having human-biting habits. The COI sequences revealed considerable genetic diversity in all three species. Comparisons to a COI sequence library of black flies in Thailand and in a public database indicated a high efficiency for specimen identification for S. nodosum and S. nigrogilvum, but this method was not successful for the S. doipuiense complex. Phylogenetic analyses revealed two divergent lineages in the S. doipuiense complex. Human-biting specimens formed a separate clade from other members of this complex. The results are consistent with the Barcoding Index Number System (BINs) analysis that found six BINs in the S. doipuiense complex. Further taxonomic work is needed to clarify the species status of these human-biting specimens.},

	abstract = {Scientists have used gene sequences and morphological data to construct tens of thousands of evolutionary trees that describe the evolutionary history of animals, plants, and microbes. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to apply an efficient and automated process for assembling published trees into a complete tree of life. This tree and the underlying data are available to browse and download from the Internet, facilitating subsequent analyses that require evolutionary trees. The tree can be easily updated with newly published data. Our analysis of coverage not only reveals gaps in sampling and naming biodiversity but also further demonstrates that most published phylogenies are not available in digital formats that can be summarized into a tree of life.Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships that unite all lineages (the tree of life) is a grand challenge. The paucity of homologous character data across disparately related lineages currently renders direct phylogenetic inference untenable. To reconstruct a comprehensive tree of life, we therefore synthesized published phylogenies, together with taxonomic classifications for taxa never incorporated into a phylogeny. We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips—the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. Although data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics.},

	abstract = {DNA barcoding was intended as a means to provide species-level identifications through associating DNA sequences from unknown specimens to those from curated reference specimens. Although barcodes were not designed for phylogenetics, they can be beneficial to the completion of the Tree of Life. The barcode database for Trichoptera is relatively comprehensive, with data from every family, approximately two-thirds of the genera, and one-third of the described species. Most Trichoptera, as with most of life's species, have never been subjected to any formal phylogenetic analysis. Here, we present a phylogeny with over 16 000 unique haplotypes as a working hypothesis that can be updated as our estimates improve. We suggest a strategy of implementing constrained tree searches, which allow larger datasets to dictate the backbone phylogeny, while the barcode data fill out the tips of the tree. We also discuss how this phylogeny could be used to focus taxonomic attention on ambiguous species boundaries and hidden biodiversity. We suggest that systematists continue to differentiate between ‘Barcode Index Numbers’ (BINs) and ‘species’ that have been formally described. Each has utility, but they are not synonyms. We highlight examples of integrative taxonomy, using both barcodes and morphology for species description.

	title = {Resolving cryptic species complexes of major tephritid pests},
	volume = {540},
	abstract = {An FAO/IAEA Co-ordinated Research Project
(CRP) on “Resolution of Cryptic Species Complexes of Tephritid Pests to Overcome Constraints to SIT Application and International Trade” was conducted from 2010 to 2015. As captured in the CRP title, the objective was to undertake targeted research into the systematics and diagnostics of taxonomically challenging fruit fly groups of economic importance. The scientific output was the accurate alignment of biological species with taxonomic names; which led to the applied outcome of assisting FAO and IAEA Member States in overcoming technical constraints to the application of the Sterile Insect Technique
(SIT) against pest fruit flies and the facilitation of international agricultural trade. Close to 50 researchers from over 20 countries participated in the CRP, using coordinated, multidisciplinary research to address, within an integrative taxonomic framework, cryptic species complexes of major tephritid pests. The following progress was made for the four complexes selected and studied:Anastrepha fraterculus complex – Eight morphotypes and their geographic and ecological distributions in Latin America were defined. The morphotypes can be considered as distinct biological species on the basis of differences in karyotype, sexual incompatibility, post-mating isolation, cuticular hydrocarbon, pheromone, and molecular analyses. Discriminative taxonomic tools using linear and geometric morphometrics of both adult and larval morphology were developed for this complex.
Bactrocera dorsalis complex – Based on genetic, cytogenetic, pheromonal, morphometric, and behavioural data, which showed no or only minor variation between the Asian/African pest fruit flies Bactrocera dorsalis, Bactrocera papayae, Bactrocera philippinensis and Bactrocera invadens, the latter three species were synonymized with Bactrocera dorsalis. Of the five target pest taxa studied, only Bactrocera dorsalis and Bactrocera carambolae remain as scientifically valid names. Molecular and pheromone markers are now available to distinguish Bactrocera dorsalis from Bactrocera carambolae.
Ceratitis FAR Complex (Ceratitis fasciventris, Ceratitis anonae, Ceratitis rosa) – Morphology, morphometry, genetic, genomic, pheromone, cuticular hydrocarbon, ecology, behaviour, and developmental physiology data provide evidence for the existence of five different entities within this fruit fly complex from the African region. These are currently recognised as Ceratitis anonae, Ceratitis fasciventris (F1 and F2), Ceratitis rosa and a new species related to Ceratitis rosa (R2). The biological limits within Ceratitis fasciventris (i.e. F1 and F2) are not fully resolved. Microsatellites markers and morphological identification tools for the adult males of the five different FAR entities were developed based on male leg structures.
Zeugodacus cucurbitae (formerly Bactrocera (Zeugodacus) cucurbitae) – Genetic variability was studied among melon fly populations throughout its geographic range in Africa and the Asia/Pacific region and found to be limited. Cross-mating studies indicated no incompatibility or sexual isolation. Host preference and genetic studies showed no evidence for the existence of host races. It was concluded that the melon fly does not represent a cryptic species complex, neither with regard to geographic distribution nor to host range. Nevertheless, the higher taxonomic classification under which this species had been placed, by the time the CRP was started, was found to be paraphyletic; as a result the subgenus Zeugodacus was elevated to genus level.},

Recent endeavors attempt to interpret contemporaneous genetic variation in the light of increasingly detailed geographical and environmental observations. Such interest has promoted the development of phylogeographic inference techniques that explicitly aim to integrate such heterogeneous data. One promising development involves reconstructing phylogeographic history on a continuous landscape. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical approach to infer continuous phylogeographic diffusion using random walk models while simultaneously reconstructing the evolutionary history in time from molecular sequence data. Moreover, by accommodating branch-specific variation in dispersal rates, we relax the most restrictive assumption of the standard Brownian diffusion process and demonstrate increased statistical efficiency in spatial reconstructions of overdispersed random walks by analyzing both simulated and real viral genetic data. We further illustrate how drawing inference about summary statistics from a fully specified stochastic process over both sequence evolution and spatial movement reveals important characteristics of a rabies epidemic. Together with recent advances in discrete phylogeographic inference, the continuous model developments furnish a flexible statistical framework for biogeographical reconstructions that is easily expanded upon to accommodate various landscape genetic features.},

This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

This study is based on the Callon’s moments of translation framework, which helps in describing the interaction between initiators of a network and other involved actors with the aim of aligning their diverse interests in order to achieve a common goal. KODI comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders from government, private sector, inter-governmental organisation, and civil society. KODI has faced various challenges since its inception in 2011, some of which include lack of adequate resources, reduced support from some of the stakeholders, and a shift in government buy-in into the initiative. This caused the initiative to stall for a period of almost two years between the year 2012 and 2013, which suggests a disconnect in the interests of some of the key actors at the time. A description of the strategies applied by the network initiators to resuscitate the initiative is provided. This also includes a description of how the interests of the various actors were aligned to achieve a common cause. The study is explanatory, and results in a practical contribution describing the strategies that can help in securing buy-in of an open government data initiative.},

	abstract = {Objective To share approaches and innovations adopted to deliver a relatively inexpensive clinical data management (CDM) framework within a low-income setting that aims to deliver quality pediatric data useful for supporting research, strengthening the information culture and informing improvement efforts in local clinical practice.

Materials and methods The authors implemented a CDM framework to support a Clinical Information Network (CIN) using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a noncommercial software solution designed for rapid development and deployment of electronic data capture tools. It was used for collection of standardized data from case records of multiple hospitals’ pediatric wards. R, an open-source statistical language, was used for data quality enhancement, analysis, and report generation for the hospitals.

Results In the first year of CIN, the authors have developed innovative solutions to support the implementation of a secure, rapid pediatric data collection system spanning 14 hospital sites with stringent data quality checks. Data have been collated on over 37 000 admission episodes, with considerable improvement in clinical documentation of admissions observed. Using meta-programming techniques in R, coupled with branching logic, randomization, data lookup, and Application Programming Interface (API) features offered by REDCap, CDM tasks were configured and automated to ensure quality data was delivered for clinical improvement and research use.

Conclusion A low-cost clinically focused but geographically dispersed quality CDM (Clinical Data Management) in a long-term, multi-site, and real world context can be achieved and sustained and challenges can be overcome through thoughtful design and implementation of open-source tools for handling data and supporting research.},

Yet access to information including geographic information systems (GIS) is challenging, particularly as data are often seen as a commodity or source of power by those who control it, a dynamic more severe in contexts like Kenya. By generating GIS data for our own transportation model and then sharing them with those interested in doing research on Nairobi, we experienced firsthand some of the power dynamics associated with accessing and generating information in the developing country context. The project had several important lessons: (1) Simply developing data does not make them open; how “open access” is provided to the data is just as important as making them freely available. (2) Developing data can show commitment to a particular place or project that can help generate support for stronger partnerships and project goals. (3) Openly sharing data about place might help push those with access to information to share information as well. Overall this research project illustrated that sharing data can help support a more open access ecosystem locally by establishing a culture of data sharing but only if those interested in using it have the technical ability to both access and use data sets provided.},

	abstract = {Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) as important and unique collections that facilitate open access.

Design/methodology/approach
– The paper presents a brief introduction of the importance of ETD as materials for open access. This is with emphasis on the Kenya Information Preservation Society (KIPS) project which has, since 1993, been digitizing theses from a number of participating institutions across the country. This paper relies heavily on literature derived from existing documentation, online searches and website exploration, and the KIPS's union list of theses and dissertations CD‐ROM. A number of contracted employees (scanning and input) were also interviewed in order to provide statistics about the contributing institutions. Findings – The paper finds that the necessity of showcasing the intellectual research of higher education institutions within Kenya is reason enough to justify making the move towards creating electronic thesis services. The benefits making ETD available outweighs that of print‐only thesis provision due to the potential for enormous dissemination and open access. Research limitations/implications –ETD is a renowned research area for consideration. Librarians should be engaged in digitization of electronic collections that will provide desirable services to end users. Such approaches boost the knowledge economy of any country.

Practical implications
– Evidence cited from the strengths of KIPS indicates that its major objective was to compile a national comprehensive database of research on Kenya, and by Kenyans. From available statistics, theses undertaken at postgraduate university levels meet the needs of Kenyan scholars. Originality/value – This paper attempts to give insights for emulating the ETD initiative by KIPS as a way to showcase the unique materials of open access, thereby making them relevant for the modern day library.},

The research used a mixed method approach, which combined qualitative, quantitative and experimental methods. This was necessary to provide a holistic view of the status of open data awareness, access and use in the country and help us better understand the underlying factors that affect the roll out, adoption and use of open data. These methods included a literature review, a user perception survey, dashboard data analysis of the open data applications, in-depth interviews with key stakeholders and a user experience experiment on three open data platforms. Findings from these techniques were aggregated and cross-analyzed to measure the extent to which technology intermediaries have increased the accessibility and utilization of open data in Kenya.},

He knew that easier access to government data on topics ranging from demographics to education could help spur innovation in business and technology and help drive the country’s economic growth. The Official Secrets Act under former President Daniel arap Moi had long prevented civil servants from sharing government data, and for the most part, the trend had continued since the 2002 election of President Mwai Kibaki. But in 2011, Ndemo won Kibaki’s approval to create an Internet portal that would serve as a one-stop shop for government census, economic, health and education data. With Kibaki’s support, Ndemo persuaded other ministries to allow access to the data, and he assembled a volunteer task force of computer programmers, data experts and ministry and World Bank officials to build the website and upload information. After the site—opendata.go.ke­—went online in July 2011, the ministry started taking crucial steps to ensure the system’s effectiveness by training journalists in how to use the data in their reporting, by encouraging software developers to build applications that manipulated the data to explore trends, and by working to streamline the continuing flow of information to the site from government institutions. The case highlights Ndemo’s efforts to open Kenya’s government to the country’s citizens and the world.},

The article presents the findings of a descriptive study that set out to evaluate the current state of IRs in Kenya. Webometric approaches and interviews with IR managers were used to collect the data for the study. The findings showed that Kenya has made some progress in adopting OA with a total of 12 IRs currently listed in the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) and five mandatory self-archiving policies listed in the Registry of Open Access Repositories Mandatory Archiving Policies (ROARMAP). Most of the IRs are owned by universities where theses and dissertations constitute the majority of the content type followed by journal articles. The results on the usage and impact of materials deposited in Kenyan IRs indicated that the most viewed publications in the repositories also received citations in Google Scholar, thereby signifying their impact and importance. The results also showed that there was a considerable interest in Swahili language publications among users of the repositories in Kenya.},

Many universities have deployed Elearning systems where E-learning based and non E-learning based educational environments coexist. Research in this area has mainly focussed on the technologies such as Web 2.0 and Free Open Source Softwares. The actual adoption, deployment and inclusions of such technologies in Institutions of Higher Learning remain undetermined. This study sought to determine the application of Web 2.0 and Open Source Softwares in Elearning with specific reference to actual adoption, deployment and inclusion. Descriptive Survey Design was used in a local Private University in Kenya to collect data about students on actual adoption, deployment and inclusion of Web 2.0 and Free Open Source Softwares in E-learning. The study found out that Open Source Softwares were the least deployed and adopted technologies in E-learning. ILIAS, EFRONT and Claroline softwares had 100\% No response implying that respondents were unaware of existence of these softwares in E-learning.},

The analysis focus onto the human-mediated interplay between the intrinsic material features of the IT artefact and the main elements of the surrounding institutional and technological environment and their influence in relation to the donor-driven reforms of the health sector. Empirical results are then used to critically discuss the main implications of the institutional and technological environment characterizing Government IT innovations in developing countries such as Kenya for the development of local OSS sustainable products. Finally, the main factors identified are then used to build an OSS business model analysis framework.

	abstract = {Background
Clinical trials data management (CTDM) remains one of the many challenges in running state of the art trials in resource-poor settings since most trials do not allocate, or have available, sufficient resources for CTDM and because of poor internet connectivity. Open-source software like OpenClinica could be a solution in such scenarios.

Findings
In 2007, the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP) adopted OpenClinica (OC) community edition, an open-source software system and we share our experience and lessons learnt since its adoption. We have used OC in three different modes; direct remote data entry from sites through Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) modems, a centralized data centre approach where all data from paper records were entered at a central location and an off-line approach where data entry was done from a copy of database hosted on a field-site server laptop, then data uploaded to a centralized server later. We have used OC in eleven trials/studies with a cumulative number of participants in excess of 6000. These include large and complex trials, with multiple sites recruiting in different regions of East Africa. In the process, we have developed substantial local capacity through hands-on training and mentorship, which we have now begun to share with other institutions in the region.

Conclusions
Our experience demonstrates that an open source data management system to manage trials’ data can be utilized to international industry standards in resource-poor countries.},

The initiative is expected to support greater public transparency andaccountability, fundamentally changing the nature of citizen-government interaction. The releaseof public data online creates a platform supporting the development of third-party applications,enabling a vehicle for expanded public outreach and engagement leading to “a more responsiveand citizen-focused government” (Madera, 2009)
This paper outlines underlying drivers, principal objectives and the evolution of the Kenya Open Data Initiative from inception to realisation. A comparative study of Kenya Open Data and related US and UK initiatives is included, highlighting implications for the applicability of a ‘default model’ in developing countries. This paper also provides preliminary insights into the platform’s access and usage patterns  since the launch, as well as perceived present and future impact of this initiative in Kenya. Finally, it outlines the vision moving forward describing the principal barriers and supportive factors that must be addressed for the effective use of public sector information in Kenya.

The Uganda/Kenya case study investigated Impact of Open Data on resource allocation for poverty eradication in Uganda and Kenya. This case study was premised on the experiences of countries that have been involved in Open Data since the beginning. Open data has its roots in the Open Government Partnership founded in 2009 and launched in 2011, initially with a membership of eight countries but which has since grown to 63 (In East Africa, Kenya and Tanzania are members but Uganda has not yet signed up despite increasing calls to do so). Its aim is providing an international platform for domestic reformers committed to making their governments more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens. There has been increasing enthusiasm by governments since then to publish data online. Many members have since established national data webportals and made avail huge amounts of data that were previously not in the public domain. The impact of this on resource allocation and the broader transparency agenda has been significant. It has created more upward information flow, local, national and international pressures and bottom-up citizen and political pressures on governments to be more open.},

However, most governments have not realised the desired value streams or outcomes from OGD. The Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI), a Government of Kenya initiative, is no exception with some moments of success but also sustainability struggles. Therefore, the focus for this paper is to understand the causal mechanisms that either enable or constrain institutionalisation of OGD initiatives. Critical realism is ideally suited as a paradigm to identify such mechanisms, but guides to its operationalisation are few. This study uses the operational approach of Bygstad, Munkvold \& Volkoff's six-step framework, a hybrid approach that melds concepts from existing critical realism models with the idea of affordances. The findings suggest that data demand and supply mechanisms are critical in institutionalising KODI and that, underpinning basic data-related affordances, are mechanisms engaging with institutional capacity, formal policy, and political support. It is the absence of such elements in the Kenya case which explains why it has experienced significant delays.},

	abstract = {Traditional, subscription-based scientific publishing has its limitations: often, articles are inaccessible to the majority of researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where journal subscriptions or one-time access fees are cost-prohibitive. Open access (OA) publishing, in which journals provide online access to articles free of charge, breaks this barrier and allows unrestricted access to scientific and scholarly information to researchers all over the globe. At the same time, one major limitation to OA is a high publishing cost that is placed on authors. Following recent developments to OA publishing policies in the UK and even LMICs, this article highlights the current status and future challenges of OA in Africa. We place particular emphasis on Kenya, where multidisciplinary efforts to improve access have been established. We note that these efforts in Kenya can be further strengthened and potentially replicated in other African countries, with the goal of elevating the visibility of African research and improving access for African researchers to global research, and, ultimately, bring social and economic benefits to the region. We (1) offer recommendations for overcoming the challenges of implementing OA in Africa and (2) call for urgent action by African governments to follow the suit of high-income countries like the UK and Australia, mandating OA for publicly-funded research in their region and supporting future research into how OA might bring social and economic benefits to Africa.},

	abstract = {Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to review the use of open access (OA) resources in Kenyan university libraries with the gist of the discussions being the status of the universities in the implementation of OA, usefulness, challenges and recommendations.

Design/methodology/approach
– The study employed descriptive research by engaging respondents in formal interviews and brief discussions. It also reviewed existing related literature on OA resources with specific reference to four university libraries in Kenya.

Findings
– Kenya as a developing country is still at the intermediate stage of embracing OA. The university libraries are among the forefront institutions helping in the adoption of OA for research, empowerment, education and information. However, compared to other universities in Africa, Kenyan universities are far many steps ahead in embracing OA.

Research limitations/implications
– The study limited itself to descriptive survey supported by face to face interviews, informal discussions and literature. This may not give 100 percentage accurate results for the study. However, the triangulation of the instruments were sufficient enough to have credible study findings.

Practical implications
– OA to information is not a simple technological issue. It raises issues of information policies, such as availability, reliability, infrastructure, technical knowledge, legal barriers and production/creation. As the Kenyan Government enhances its efforts in going digital, universities and especially the libraries have become key stakeholders in the arranging and availing of this information through OA. It is therefore important to review the gains made and the challenges encountered by Kenyan university libraries in as far as OA is concerned.

Originality/value
– This paper discusses OA status in university libraries in Kenya, which is a new development in the information cycles in Africa.},

	abstract = {This paper is based on the findings of a study that evaluated the initiatives taken by East African countries to embrace the open access movement. Specifically, the study analysed the position of East African countries in disseminating open access literature in Africa and globally; determined the contribution of each East African country to global open access literature; identified the type of document as well as Open source software they used. Moreover, the study analysed the subject content of OARs and identified the language for the archived items. The study first used literature review to determine current status of open access in East Africa, then the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) were accessed to get the required data. The results revealed that East African counties make only a miniscule contribution to Open Access literature of about 0.022 percent of items found in global OARs and 1.2 percent by number of repositories. The study concluded that East African countries with a slight exception of Kenya lag far behind in open access literature. The study, therefore, recommends more efforts to be made by individual East African countries to make necessary arrangements required to adopt and use OA repositories to enhance free access to knowledge and information and, consequently, boost socioeconomic development in the region.},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {In this age of information explosion no library is able to satisfy all the needs of its users due to various constraints. It is because of this phenomenon that the concept of library IMS has developed. To achieve this, those who are responsible for the libraries should take into account their active and passive users. Furthermore, not only the academicians who make use of the libraries but also those who do not make use of them should be considered. It is against this background that this study main purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of opens source Integrated Management Information Systems (MIS) in Libraries, Strathmore University as a case. The objectives of the study were: to determine the effectiveness of open source integrated information management system in use at Strathmore university library, to find out the users’ attitudes towards the integrated management information system at Strathmore University Library’, to find out the challenges facing the integrated management systems in Strathmore university and suggest recommendations that would help in improving the use of Koha at Strathmore University Library. The study utilized a case study and was carried out within Strathmore University. The study found out that the integration of information management system in the provision of library service is to a great degree perceived to be effective. However, there was need for improvement. The findings further revealed that, most members of staff and students have positive attitudes towards the use of Koha at the Strathmore University library. This implies that they would appreciate being trained to use it and support any efforts to improve the system. The study concluded that there were still enormous challenges in integration of the management information system in Libraries due some reasons for instance the constant change of software, internet failure and the lack of technology know how among some clients. The study recommended that there is need for continuous training to students and staff to keep then abreast of the technological changes of integrated information systems and innovative strategies of dealing with the challenges associated with Koha.},

Today, an increasing number of institutions and individuals share digital resources via the Internet free of any legal, financial or technical barriers. As such, open educational resources may be part of a solution to this problem. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between students’ perceptions and utilization of open educational resources for academic work in private universities in Kenya. The study used the correlational research design. The study targeted 5,375 undergraduate part time students. While the accessible population was 2716 bachelor of Education part time students drawn from five private universities purposively chosen. Proportionate sampling was used to determine the subjects from each university. Simple random sampling was used to select respondents from the 3rd and 4th years. Data was collected using students’ questionnaire and focus group discussion groups. There was also a positive relationship between utilization of open educational resources and students’ perceptions on open educational resources and therefore the relationship is significant (r (321) = 0.394; p {\textless}0.05). This means that the more students have positive perceptions on the open educational resources the more they will use open educational resources for academic work. Descriptive statistics (percentages and frequencies) were used to analyze quantitative data while Regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Exchange of information within the Government is usually through formal 
communication such as official letters, gazette notices , internal memos, circulars, 
print media and also through minutes . This has not been very effective, due to lack of 
seamless exchange of information among Government Ministries since they work 
independently. The main cause being lack of an interoperable platform in terms of 
software which would help ease exchange of information. As a result of this, a lot of 
inefficiencies in service delivery to the citizenry have been experienced. This has 
been confirmed through ratings in performance contracting of various sectors in 
government over the years. 
In order to achieve software interoperability framework within the Government, 
quantitative research method was used in collaboration with other research methods 
such as descriptive research. The research was carried out within the National 
Government to ascertain various issues that relate to software interoperability with a 
view of developing a standard framework that will act as a guideline within the 
National Government. Through the research , it was possible to justify how lack of 
this important guideline within government has led to denial of associated benefits 
to the citizenry. Since there is no universal standardized software interoperability 
framework that any Government could directly adopt without customization, it was 
important to develop a software interoperability framework that is based on known 
user requirements within the Government of Kenya hence the need for a Software 
Interoperability Framework. 
The main objective of the research being to develop software interoperability 
framework between open source and proprietary software, this was accomplished by 
enhancing an existing software interoperability conceptual model by ATHENA 
consortium. The framework has further been improved by introducing various 
parameters and components that have a direct effect on the framework due to their 
interrelation nature hence making the framework more comprehensive.},

The study focuses to determine the key challenges facing the usage and implementation of open source software for teaching, learning and management activities of private universities in Kenya and proposes a framework for implementing open source systems in Kenyan universities. The study adopted descriptive survey design. 
The findings from this research provides evidence that most universities need to provide for adequate budget to go towards supporting the systems use the main conclusions drawn from this study are that private chartered universities in Kenya have implemented Open Source Software. This is perhaps the reason why many private chartered 
universities have automated most university processes, and that Moodle Open Source Software is widely used.},

	abstract = {Open Access Journals (OAJs) and Institutional Repositories (IRs) are Open
Access (OA) outlets that provide a platform for disseminating research
findings. Although these outlets have been introduced in universities to
increase dissemination, access and impact of staff, academic staff adoption of
such outlets in Africa has been slow and their use of these outlets in
disseminating their research works has been low. This study sought to establish
the challenges academic staff face with regard to OA outlets. It established
outlets employed by academic staff in dissemination, their awareness, skills
and training, attitude and use of OA outlets. Rogers Diffusion of Innovations
theory was used. Descriptive design using survey method was used for this
study. The target population was 15,000 academic staff from which a sample
of 381 was selected using stratified sampling technique. The study was
conducted in 12 private and 7 public universities in Kenya. Questionnaires
were used to collect data. A pilot study to assure validity and reliability was
conducted, yielding a Cronbach correlation coefficient of 0.76 which was
considered acceptable. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used
to generate data. Descriptive statistics such as percentages and means were
used for analysis. The study established that academics preferred traditional
publishing outlets for dissemination but they were associated with problems of
accessibility, cost and delays in publishing while OA outlets were associated
with low quality. General awareness of OAP among academic staff was high
(66\%) but awareness of specific OA aspects was low. A majority of academic
staff were active consumers of OAJs (74.3\%) and IR content (75.7\%) but not
prolific contributors at 20.9\% and 27.5\% respectively. Only 29\% of the
academic staff had training in OAJs and IRs. The study concluded that
traditional publishing outlets were utilized more than OA outlets and
awareness of OAP was low among scholars. The study recommends awareness
creation of OA outlets, capacity building in self archiving, institutionalization
of OA outlets in Kenyan universities and enhancement of academic - library
staff collaborations, among others. The study findings are significant to all
stakeholders interested in dissemination of research findings through OA
outlets.},

This study also explored the challenges encountered in the adoption of open source software, as an alternate to the proprietary software, in computing.
The study focused on all the 43 commercial banks in Kenya. The banking sector was selected largely because it has always taken a lead role in implementing strategic management practices and is reported to spend huge amounts on the same. The respondents were IT Managers in the 43 commercial banks.
The questionnaires were used to collect information from the information technology
department and other employees concerned with information technology adoption and implementation. The basis of using descriptive measure was to give a basis for determining the weights of the variables under the study. The findings were then presented using tables, pie charts, and bar graphs for easier interpretation. The analysis and data collected the following discussions, conclusions and recommendations were made.
The study revealed that the majority of respondents were males. Majority of these respondents were in their positions for about 5 years, had a degree and were of age 30 years and below which was a clear indication that they were young. On the extent of use of OSS in the commercial banks, the survey findings indicate that majority of the banks were partially using open source on their desktop computers and planned to increase the OSS share by adopting to replace some components. The OSS applications that were mostly being used were Linux and Mozilla.
The survey findings indicate that OSS in commercial banks in Kenya is widely being used and there are various challenges being faced in the adoption. These challenges include a need for an analysis of a return on investment on using OSS, high switching costs when migrating from proprietary software to OSS and uncertainty on the availability of support services.},

among others, have not been able to provide crucial reports to decision makers. Decision
makers require reports that are timely, accurate, actionable, and depicting the whole

BI systems provide timely, accurate, and actionable information to the right person
enabling quick and correct decisions. Higher learning institutions like universities, being
one of the organizations, require such systems for effective management. Past studies
reveal little adoption of BI in Kenyan Universities. This research project was geared
towards implementing a Business Intelligence System for Kenyan Universities; taking a
case of the Technical University of Kenya. Kimball‟s dimension modeling was used in
designing a data warehouse. The system was implemented using Hadoop cluster integrated
with R Statistical Software. Data warehouse was developed and analysis achieved using
Hive Query Language and R through data visualization and dashboards. Comparison with
the state-of-art open source BI tools was conducted. The project revealed great
opportunities for open source tools in data analytics for universities. The study
recommended a real-time BI system that would relay live status of events for effective
decision-making and also incorporation of unstructured data from social media in
improving the University analytics.},

telecommunications service providers in Kenya namely Safaricom, Airtel Kenya,
Orange Telkom and Equitel. The conclusion of the study is that there is significant
adoption of open source software by telecommunication companies in Kenya with
leading benefits of adoption being cost efficiency, increased software flexibility and
avoiding vendor lock-in. The above benefits notwithstanding, there are challenges that
are associated with the adoption as well and this include lack of proper software
support, switching costs from proprietary software and quality of open source
software which cannot be relied upon to run mission critical telecommunication
services. However, with the rapidly evolving technology and changing consumer

	abstract = {Billions of shillings worth of domestic researches are conducted every year in Kenya, end up in library shelves and office drawers in the institutions and are rarely disseminated. As a result, immediate steps must be taken to share the research output for development. A major recent innovation in research sharing within the domain of libraries is institutional repositories. In 2011, cumulatively of over 65\% of libraries in Kenya had embraced or were in the process of establishing digital repositories in their institutions while 35\% had not. This study aimed at establishing the current status of institutional repositories in Kenya.This study used Diffusion of innovation Theory (DOI) to develop a theoretical framework to guide the study and mixed method design to collect and analyze data from sample of 111 Institutional repository administrators purposively sampled. SoGoSurvey, an online platform was used to collect and analyze the results real-time as received from respondents. It also presented the analyzed data in tables, totals, percentages, charts and graphs. The findings revealed that the Kenyan Government had a stake for the successes of the implementation of digital institutional repositories since majority of libraries in KLISC were government institutions. The findings also showed that digital repositories were managed by librarians in different library departments and not necessarily digital repository librarians. The high rate of repository managers with other designations was also a clear sign that repository management had not acquired a fully recognized professional status in Kenya. In addition, the results indicated that although majority of KLISC member libraries had established or were in the process of establishing institutional repositories, there were still a sizable number of libraries that are yet to develop institutional repositories.Key Words: Institutional Repositories, Libraries, Consortium},

	abstract = {University education involves exposure to wide reading and research among students. This is more critical to postgraduate students, who are required to read much more on their own and prepare for their research and thesis undertakings. Looking at universities in the third world countries, there are challenges of access to current and relevant literature. This is due to lack of modern library facilities as well as high costs of accessing the available ones. The uptake of modern technology in learning and teaching including e-learning and Open Educational Resources are still out of reach by many learners and lecturers alike. Distance learners are also faced with time constraints as they work, and many of them are very far from any access to literature. This study aimed at determining the level of access to literature and related challenges including attitude, among postgraduate students who are in the open and distance learning (ODL) mode at Egerton University. The study revealed the gaps existing in access to literature and their effects on the quality of learning and research outputs of these learners. Further the findings revealed the attitudinal issues that have compounded this problem as learners and academicians transit from traditional sources of literature to the use of modern technology.Key Words: access to literature, attitude, open and distance learning, postgraduate students, modern technology, internet, open educational resources.},

	abstract = {This study explores Open Data actors in Kenya, focusing on the issue of transparency and accountability. Drawing on an exploratory quantitative analysis of existing statistical material of usage of the Kenya Open Data Initiative website and 15 qualitative interviews conducted primarily in Nairobi, the study analyses key factors – both enabling and disabling – that shape transparency initiatives connected to Open Data in Kenya.  
The material is analysed from three perspectives:  
a) a review based on existing research around impact and effectiveness of transparency and accountability initiatives;  
b) based on theories on human behaviour in connection to transparency and accountability; and  
c) introducing a critical perspective on power relations based on Michel Foucault’s concept of ‘governmentality’.  
The study shows that the Kenya Open Data Initiative has potential to become an effective transparency and accountability initiative in Kenya, but that its future is heavily dependent on current trends within the political context and fluctuations in power relations. Applying a stronger user-perspective and participatory approach is critical. 
Open Data is a relatively new area within the governance and development field, and academia can play an important role in enhancing methodology and impact assessments to create more effective and sustainable initiatives and ensure that future Open Data initiatives can be both accessible and constitute a base for accountability.},

	abstract = {Comparative phylogeographic studies often reveal disparate levels of sequence divergence between lineages spanning a common geographic barrier, leading to the conclusion that isolation was nonsynchronous. However, only rarely do researchers account for the expected variance associated with ancestral coalescence and among-taxon variation in demographic history. We introduce a flexible approximate Bayesian computational (ABC) framework that can test for simultaneous divergence (TSD) using a hierarchical model that incorporates idiosyncratic differences in demographic history across taxon pairs. The method is tested across a range of conditions and is shown to be accurate even with single-locus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. We apply this method to a landmark dataset of putative simultaneous vicariance, eight geminate echinoid taxon pairs thought to have been split by the Isthmus of Panama 3.1 million years ago. The ABC posterior estimates are not consistent with a history of simultaneous vicariance given these data. Subsequent ABC estimates under a constrained model that assumes two divergence times across the eight taxon pairs suggests simultaneous divergence 3.1 million years ago in seven of the taxon pairs and a more recent divergence in the remaining taxon pair. These ABC estimates on the simultaneous divergence of the seven taxon pairs correspond to a DNA substitution rate of approximately 1.59\% per lineage per million years at the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I gene. This ABC framework can easily be modified to analyze single taxon-pair datasets and/or be expanded to include multiple loci, migration, recombination, and other idiosyncratic demographic histories. The flexible aspect of ABC and its built-in evaluation of estimator bias and statistical power has the potential to greatly enhance statistical rigor in phylogeographic studies.},

	abstract = {Testing for simultaneous vicariance across comparative phylogeographic data sets is a notoriously difficult problem hindered by mutational variance, the coalescent variance, and variability across pairs of sister taxa in parameters that affect genetic divergence. We simulate vicariance to characterize the behaviour of several commonly used summary statistics across a range of divergence times, and to characterize this behaviour in comparative phylogeographic datasets having multiple taxon-pairs. We found Tajima's D to be relatively uncorrelated with other summary statistics across divergence times, and using simple hypothesis testing of simultaneous vicariance given variable population sizes, we counter-intuitively found that the variance across taxon pairs in Nei and Li's net nucleotide divergence (πnet), a common measure of population divergence, is often inferior to using the variance in Tajima's D across taxon pairs as a test statistic to distinguish ancient simultaneous vicariance from variable vicariance histories. The opposite and more intuitive pattern is found for testing more recent simultaneous vicariance, and overall we found that depending on the timing of vicariance, one of these two test statistics can achieve high statistical power for rejecting simultaneous vicariance, given a reasonable number of intron loci ({\textgreater} 5 loci, 400 bp) and a range of conditions. These results suggest that components of these two composite summary statistics should be used in future simulation-based methods which can simultaneously use a pool of summary statistics to test comparative the phylogeographic hypotheses we consider here.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a recently developed technique for solving problems in Bayesian inference. Although typically less accurate than, for example, the frequently used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, they have greater flexibility because they do not require the specification of a likelihood function. For this reason considerable amounts of data can be analysed and more complex models can be used providing, thereby, a potential better fit of the model to the data. Since its first applications in the late 1990s its usage has been steadily increasing. The framework was originally developed to solve problems in population genetics. However, as its efficiency was recognized its popularity increased and, consequently, it started to be used in fields as diverse as phylogenetics, ecology, conservation, molecular evolution and epidemiology. While the ABC algorithm is still being greatly studied and alterations to it are being proposed, the statistical approach has already reached a level of maturity well demonstrated by the number of related computer packages that are being developed. As improved ABC algorithms are proposed, the expansion of the use of this method can only increase. In this paper we are going to depict the context that led to the development of ABC focusing on the field of infectious disease epidemiology. We are then going to describe its current usage in such field and present its most recent developments.},

It is especially important when the model to be fit has no explicit likelihood function, which happens for computational (or simulation-based) models such as those that are popular in cognitive neuroscience and other areas in psychology. However, ABC is usually applied only to models with few parameters. Extending ABC to hierarchical models has been difficult because high-dimensional hierarchical models add computational complexity that conventional ABC cannot accommodate. In this paper, we summarize some current approaches for performing hierarchical ABC and introduce a new algorithm called Gibbs ABC. This new algorithm incorporates well-known Bayesian techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the ABC approach for estimation of hierarchical models. We then use the Gibbs ABC algorithm to estimate the parameters of two models of signal detection, one with and one without a tractable likelihood function.},

Historically, such data have been analysed by using model-based methods. Models are useful for sharpening intuition, for explanation and for prediction: they add to our understanding of how the data were formed, and they can provide quantitative answers to questions of interest. We outline some of these model-based approaches, including the coalescent, and discuss the applicability of the computational methods that are necessary given the highly complex nature of current and future data sets.},

	title = {Creating impacts with open data for agriculture and nutrition in {Kenya}},
	url = {http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/534208},
	abstract = {Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. It is widely recognised as a priority goal by
the development community and a driver for economic growth. Open data has the potential to
contribute to one of the sustainable development goals: ending hunger. Recent high level interest has
drawn special attention to the importance of open data in light of growing and critical global challenges affecting the health and welfare of people everywhere, including: the G8 Open Data Charter in 2013, the World Bank in 2014 and the GODAN Summit in New York in 2016. The June 2017 Ministerial Conference on Open data for Agriculture and Nutrition hosted by the Kenyan Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries culminated in the Nairobi declaration in which 15 African countries commit themselves to strengthen the role of open data for their agricultural development.
The Government of Kenya is actively pursuing an open data policy in the field of agriculture and nutrition and has its own open data portal that features hundreds of data sets on agriculture and nutrition. There are also many other data collections that are of great value. With all these data sources available on the supply side, there is scope to deploy them for creating impacts in agriculture and nutrition, specifically with respect to food security. However, steps of enrichment of data to information and knowledge need to be taken, just as understanding the (user) needs or the beneficiaries that could work with the data.
This project scoped the supply (i.e. available datasets) and demand (requirements of end users) of (open) data for agriculture and nutrition in the Kenyan context and developed showcases and a prototype, that focused on potential impacts of use of data in agriculture and nutrition in Kenya. The
showcases and prototype are transferable to other African countries:
1. Support to student led agricultural extension (led by University of Nairobi)
2. Using open data to support evidence-based policy making (led by WEnR)
3. Supporting start-ups (led by CTA)
4. Joint actions across the value chain for people, planet and profit (led by CABI). This
showcase is the basis for the prototype (co-developed by WEnR and CABI).
During a reflection workshop in Nairobi with over 25 representatives from Kenyan government, -business and -research, feedback was gathered to test whether the problem was correctly identified, if the right (open) data was used, if the proposed solution was workable and whether the solution had an obvious business model with stakeholders.
Main findings include:
● collaboration among value chain players through open data will optimize the supply chain with
shared benefits
● business involvement is crucial to guarantee continuity of a solution and must be present from
the onset.
● User driven co-development is necessary to identify required data, share local data and open
local data since not all the required data is openly available, or easily accessible.
● prototyping is a useful mechanism to match supply with demand. We recommend co-development of a prototype to bring open data closer to a fully functioning application via a standardised method. The prototype could focus on the middle-tier of identifying and obtaining the right inputs and strengthen the position of and trust between farmers, agri-dealers and
traders.},

	abstract = {Literature has revealed that open access journals and institutional repositories provide an 
outlet used for dissemination of scholarly research. Although the introduction of these 
outlets in universities has led to increased access and dissemination of research findings, 
the usage of these outlets is yet to be realized. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
adoption of open access initiatives in dissemination of research findings by academic 
staff in selected universities in Kenya. The objectives of this study were; to establish the 
types of outlets accessed by academic staff, find out the extent to which academic staff 
were aware of open access, to determine the level of usage of OA outlets by academic 
staff in accessing and disseminating their research work and to find out the attitude of 
academic staff towards open access initiatives. The study utilized the theory of 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Descriptive research design was used for this 
study. In total 301 academic staff from both University of Nairobi and Africa Nazarene 
University were selected using simple random sampling methods. Stratified sampling 
was used to stratify the academic staff according to their academic status and simple 
random sampling was used to get samples from each of the strata. Questionnaires, 
document and desk review were used to collect data and information. A Pilot study was 
conducted at Catholic University of Eastern Africa to assure validity and reliability. 
Analysis of data was through Microsoft excel and Statistical Package for Social Sciences 
(SPSS) and was presented in form of tables of frequencies and percentages, and charts. 
Descriptive statistics such as percentages and means were used for analysis. Findings 
from this study revealed that the attitude of academic staff towards OA was positive 
signifying acceptance of this mode of scholarly communication. However, traditional 
outlets were still the preferred mode of scholarly communication by academic staff and 
that open access publishing was low. The study recommends institutionalization of open 
access publishing in Universities in Kenya and training on open access issues to improve 
access and dissemination of scholarly research. This research will be useful to academic 
institutions, education and policy administrators and libraries in Kenya so as to improve 
the usage of open access outlets among academic staff.},

	abstract = {Purpose
– Despite its fast growth and penetration in all sectors, it has been noted that open source software (OSS) is yet to find its optimal place in libraries, particularly libraries in the developing countries. Lack of documented information on the experiences and use of open source integrated library system (ILS) is a major drawback, and so the need for this study. The proposed study aims to help to investigate and test usability and cost effectiveness of a typical OSS for ILS. It will involve deploying the software from installation, configuration to creating customized user interfaces and structures that are specific to the requirements of the library's parent organization. The cost and performance of the OSS will then be compared with that of a typical commercial based software with the same functionalities.

Design/methodology/approach
– A preliminary study has been conducted to collect data from libraries in the country through distribution of questionnaires to provide data for accurate analysis that will form the basis for recommendations. The target group includes library and IT personnel in the various institutions and the end-users within sample group. A case study is proposed to help establish OSS effectiveness in libraries. To test a typical OSS, parameters are to be drawn from two models – open source maturity model and business readiness rating.

Findings
– A casual observation of the Kenyan situation reveals that the majority of academic, public and research libraries depend on commercial, free or locally developed systems. This scenario may be attributed to lack of knowledge (or interest) in OSS alternatives and lack of sufficient technical expertise to support them. While there are quite a number of libraries and librarians worldwide that have shown a great interest in OSS, few library administrators have actually implemented OSS. Could this be due to fear of taking on the risks that may come with reliance on open source library automation systems? Is the low uptake due to lack of sufficient technical expertise in the libraries? The research outcomes will help formulate a model and guidelines to be used by systems librarians considering the use of OSS for library processes. Factors to be considered when deciding on OSS will be outlined.

Research limitations/implications
– This paper is of importance to library personnel in Kenya as it establishes the effectiveness of OSS, with the aim of empowering the library staff who have for a long time relied on their IT departments and vendors for systems installation and implementation.

Originality/value
– The study will result in a comprehensive evaluation of the economic and functional advantages of OSS as an alternative for the library in Kenya. Librarians involved in selection of software for their libraries will find this helpful when deciding on the type of software to select for their libraries. It will help to enlighten library professional about the value of OSS and how they can participate in the development of their own systems, instead of always relying on vendors.},

The paper presents reviews of the emerging themes, highlights possible opportunities and challenges for building sustainable infrastructure for open data and effective citizen engagement strategies, and finally draws conclusions for possible policy debates and policy formulation. In so doing, the paper will help to highlight the emerging landscape of Open Data in Kenya and Uganda particularly with the focus on the infrastructure of data communities of civic engagement, their incentives and how this conceptions influence open data movements.
This paper is organized around the following research questions: Does the application of open data by public institutions in, say, education and health affect their service provision to the public? What incentives drive public institutions to embrace open data: is it the need to improve service provision, or the skills and knowledge available in the public sector, the political leadership, the change in public administration policies supporting open data or available information technology? And will the desire by government officials to have real time interactions with the citizens be motivating enough for public agencies to invest in essential competencies that enable openness in government data? How about the push from other communities that are organized around the ideologies of transparency, accountability, equity, relevance and responsiveness to community needs, and effectiveness and efficiency of governance systems and processes? Does this influence the conception and implementation of open data (Gregg Brown 2010)? Lastly, how do the access to enabling information

	abstract = {Spanning nearly 13,000 km, the Palearctic region provides an opportunity to examine the level of geographic coverage required for a DNA barcode reference library to be effective in identifying species with broad ranges. This study examines barcode divergences between populations of 102 species of Lepidoptera from Europe and South Siberia, sites roughly 6,000 km apart. While three-quarters of these species showed divergence between their Asian and European populations, these divergence values ranged between 0–1\%, distinctly less than the distance to the Nearest-Neighbor species in all but a few cases. Our results suggest that further taxonomic studies may be required for 16 species that showed either extremely low interspecific or high intraspecific variation. For example, seven species pairs showed low or no barcode divergence, but four of these cases are likely to reflect taxonomic over-splitting while the others involve species pairs that are either young or show evidence for introgression. Conversely, some of the nine species with deep intraspecific divergence at varied spatial levels may include overlooked species. Although these 16 cases require further investigation, our overall results indicate that barcode reference libraries based on records from one locality can be very effective in identifying specimens across an extensive geographic area.},

	abstract = {The Internet has been celebrated for its ability to erode barriers between nations. Social media is a powerful medium that can unite, inform, and move people. One post can start a chain of events that changes the world. It gives users fast access to and sharing of information and facilitates ease of communication. However, the Internet allows for a lot of negativity as well. There has been an increase in hate speech activities on social media in the Kenyan cyber space.  
The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) was established to facilitate and promote equality of opportunity, good relations, harmony and peaceful co-existence between persons of the different ethnic and racial communities of Kenya, and to advise the Government on all aspects thereof (Act No, 12, 2008). In particular, the NCIC Act of 2008 is mandated to curb hate speech.  
This research studied existing hate speech detection tools in use by NCIC, then identified gaps and challenges faced. A technical solution (tool for analyzing hate speech) was proposed that can be implemented by the NCIC and the government to respond to hate-speech cases perpetrated through social media platforms. The developed tool tracked challenges and gaps in the existing tools currently in use by NCIC for hate speech monitoring, detection and analysis. Due to the differences in Application Programming Interface (API) implementation on the variety of social media platforms used in Kenya, the scope of this research is limited to Twitter.  
This research employed the use of predictive analytics for text classification using Naïve Bayes. A tool that uses the predictive model in assistance to detection of hate-speech online was developed to conceptualize the solutions discussed in this research.},

	abstract = {Access to information and knowledge is the fundamental right of every human, but this is not always achieved without limitations. Today, an increasing number of institutions and individuals share digital resources via the Internet free of any legal, financial or technical barriers. The high demand for university education in Kenya has put more pressure on the existing learning resources such as print resources, whose cost partly makes education more expensive among other factors. As such, open educational resources may be part of a solution to this problem. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between students’ awareness and utilization of open educational resources for academic work in private universities in Kenya Correlational research design was used and the target population of the study was 5,375 undergraduate part time students. Purposive sampling was used to select participating private universities since not all of them offer Bachelor of Education part time programme, while proportionate sampling was used to determine the respondents from each university. Simple random sampling was used to select respondents from the 3rd and 4th years. Data was collected using students’ questionnaire. Reliability coefficient was estimated using the Cronbach alpha. A reliability coefficient of 0.77 was found acceptable for this study since it was way above the 0.7 alpha coefficient set as adequate. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse quantitative data while regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The study revealed that there is a positive relationship between utilization and awareness index and therefore the relationship is significant (r (321) = 0.373; p {\textless}0.05). The researcher concluded that the students need to be sensitized more on OERs so that their awareness is increased and thereby increasing OERs utilization.},

This has been necessitated by the rising cost of print information resources coupled with the dwindling library budgets. In addition, space utilization has been affected due to the storage of student projects within the libraries. The purpose of the study was to determine the uptake of open access initiatives and incentives undertaken in middle level college libraries in Kenya with the view to improve delivery of information services in libraries. The study sought to establish the initiatives and incentives used to implement and sustain open access in middle level college libraries with special reference to the Kenya Institute of Management Library Network. It established the methods used to promote open access initiatives in middle level college libraries. Objectives of the study were: explore the components that determine quality and quantity of research publications, assess the impact of Open Access incentives in improving delivery of library services in an academic library, investigate ICT infrastructure and components necessary for the implementation of open access and explore the use of information literacy as a model for sensitization of open access at the Kenya Institute of Management. Nature of the study was based on a case study approach where both qualitative and quantitative were used. It targeted a total population of 155 respondents that included Librarians, senior library assistants, library assistants, school of management staff and lectures. The sample of the study was 110 respondents who were sampled through purposive sampling method. Data collection methods included use of survey questionnaires, telephone interviews. Qualitative and quantitative data was analyzed and involved the application of tables and pie chart. The study found out that middle level libraries could improve the quality and quantity of research by use of policies, availing local content research as an incentive for publishing in open access, implementation of an institutional repository, application of various ICT components such as good intranet and networking system, use of webometrics in raising the impact factor of research. Thus, the study proposed several recommendations which included; more research should be conducted on open access in middle level colleges’ more advocation of open access should be provided through information literacy, the library should initiate publishing of research in open access institutional repository and to establish a publishing department.},

	title = {Author: {Supervisor}: {Second} reader:},
	abstract = {This thesis examines how and under what conditions Open Educational Resources (OER) can improve the dissemination of knowledge in Sub Saharan Africa. According to UNESCO’s definition, OER are digitised materials offered freely and openly for educators, students and self-learners to use and reuse for teaching, learning and research educational materials2 . The OER movement has mainly been led from the West, by large institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Thus, there is a danger that Africans will be consigned to the role of consumers of OER instead of producers. Nonetheless, OER offer great potentials for Africa if implemented appropriately. There is little literature on OER dealing specifically with Sub Sahara Africa, and the handful of articles that have been published on this topic take a narrow educational approach and avoid wider socio-economic and socio-political questions. Hence, this research examines not only how OER can be used as a cost-effective tool to improve the quality of education, but also how it might alleviate or worsen problems inhibiting knowledge dissemination such as information imperialism, brain drain, lack of access to education and knowledge to disadvantaged groups, intolerance to independent debate and civil conflict. In order to find some preliminary answers to these questions, additional data were gathered by conducting over twenty interviews with experts on OER in general or on ICT, education and development in Sub Saharan Africa. The bottom line is that OER can help in dealing with some of the problems inhibiting the effective dissemination of knowledge in Sub Saharan Africa. However, only creating the necessary technological infrastructure in order to deliver OER will not be enough. The concept of OER can only work if Africans become more involved in the creation and adaptation OER according to their specific needs. Institutional, nation African wide and international policy frameworks should be put in place to enable this to happen. In order to establish such a policyframework, African champions are needed on all levels to engage in awareness raising and capacity building around the concept of OER and to start up pilot projects. Moreover, OER networks should be developed which can not only affect change on the policy level, but also on the lives of African people.},

By removing barriers to online data and encouraging publication in Open Access formats and Open Data archives, OS seeks to expand the role, reach and value of research. The promises of OS imply a set of expectations about what different publics hope to gain from research, how accountability and participation can be enhanced, and what makes science public in the first place. This paper presents empirical material from fieldwork undertaken in (bio)chemistry laboratories in Kenya and South Africa to examine the extent to which these ideals can be realized in a sub-Saharan context. To analyse the challenges African researchers face in making use of freely available data, we draw from Amartya Sen’s Capabilities Approach. His theorisations of ‘conversion factors’ helps to understand how seemingly minor economic and social contingencies can hamper the production and (re-)use of online data. In contrast to initiatives that seek to make more data available, we suggest the need to facilitate a more egalitarian engagement with online data resources.},

In view of the low purchasing power in developing countries, open access (OA) publishing avails needed reading material for all who have access to the Internet. Foreign sponsored research in developing countries can uplift the living standards of the people in these regions if the results of the findings can influence policy and are made available to the people studied. This study sought to establish if research findings of foreign sponsored research are published in OA publications. The study conducted a survey on leading local medical research institutions in Kenya using secondary data and interviews with key informants in these institutions. The results failed to support the hypothesis that foreign sponsored researchers are published in prescribed journals as a prerequisite by the sponsors. Instead, they indicated that local researchers published in international subscription journals because of their desire for prestige and wide reach. Consequently, the North-South knowledge inequality is perpetuated more by the local elite, whose desire for international recognition overrides social benefits, thereby supporting the hypothesis that foreign funded research on mutual aid in Kenya results in more private than social benefits. There is a need for the local learned society to embrace a paradigm shift towards building reputable local journals and accepting the OA concept.},

	abstract = {Open source products such as software development tools and server applications are gaining popularity among expert users. There is however a notable lag in adoption of desktop open source software among ordinary users especially in Africa. A number of critical factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions have been suggested as the determinants of Information and Communication Technologies adoption in general. This study deemed it important to establish if the above factors are the determinants of desktop open source software adoption in Africa. 
The study aimed to establish the Open Source Software adoption levels among university students in Kenya as well as the factors affecting Open Source Software adoption in this population. The author further aimed to assess the applicability of popular technology acceptance models in the adoption of the software in the population under study. The study employed literature review, quantitative and qualitative approaches. The study also used both descriptive and explanatory research designs in answering the research questions. The Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology was used as a theoretical framework because it has synthesised all its major predecessors and accommodated all the predecessors constructs. The other reason The Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology was used is because the model was developed specifically for predicting voluntary technology adoption. 
This study established that the adoption of Free Open Source Software products in Kenya is very low and existing literature revealed that this is also the case in other developing countries. The study concluded that the factors affecting adoption of desktop Open Source Software by Kenyan university students are usability, user training, Open Source Software compatibility, social influence, prior experience, social economic status, job market demands, proprietary software piracy culture and patent and copyright laws. 
Hence the study suggested that the existing technology adoption models are not appropriate in predicting technology adoption in an Africa setup. The study proposed and validated an appropriate model that fits in this context.},

A descriptive bibliometric approach was adopted for the study. Data was extracted from two world repository directories (Registry of Open Access Repositories - ROAR and Directory of Open Access Repositories - DOAR) and Directory of Open Access Journals – DOAJ to determine the presence of Africa and size of repositories and records found in the directories. Findings reveal that only 20 African countries have presence in ROAR and DOAJ, but 22 countries have presence in DOAR. South Africa has more repositories in ROAR and DOAR while Egypt has over 70\% of African contributions to DOAJ. The subject coverage of the repositories indicates that there are more publications in the sciences than there are in the social sciences and humanities; the preferred languages of publication in the directories are English, German and French. Though there is slow adoption of publishing in open access journals in Africa, there has been an increase in the number of open access journal articles from 2,019 in 2005 to 24,997 in 2014.

Furthermore, the computation of the likelihood function for huge trees of more than 1,000 organisms is computationally intensive due to a large amount of ﬂoating point operations and high memory consumption. Within this context, the present paper compares two competing mathematical models that account for evolutionary rate heterogeneity: the Γ and CAT models. The intention of this paper is to show that—from a purely empirical point of view—CAT can be used instead of Γ. The main advantage of CAT over Γ consists in signiﬁcantly lower memory consumption and faster inference times. An experimental study using RAxML has been performed on 19 real-world datasets comprising 73 up to 1,663 DNA sequences. Results show that CAT is on average 5.5 times faster than Γ and—surprisingly enough—also yields trees with slightly superior Γ likelihood values. The usage of the CAT model decreases the amount of average L2 and L3 cache misses by factor 8.55.},

	abstract = {Background VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use. Methods When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. Results VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Discussion VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.},

As environmental assessment and monitoring programmes may require biodiversity information at multiple levels, we pay particular attention to the DNA metabarcoding method and discuss a number of bioinformatic tools and considerations for producing DNA-based indicators using operational taxonomic units (OTUs), taxa at a variety of ranks and community composition. By developing the capacity to harness the advantages provided by the newest technologies, investigators can “scale up” by increasing the number of samples and replicates processed, the frequency of sampling over time and space, and even the depth of sampling such as by sequencing more reads per sample or more markers per sample. The ability to scale up is made possible by the reduced hands-on time and cost per sample provided by the newest kits, platforms and software tools. Results gleaned from broad-scale monitoring will provide opportunities to address key scientific questions linked to biodiversity and its dynamics across time and space as well as being more relevant for policymakers, enabling science-based decision-making, and provide a greater socio-economic impact.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.
RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.
CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

Sequencing technologies become cheaper and easier to use and, thus, large-scale evolutionary studies towards the origins of life for all species and their evolution becomes more and more challenging. Databases holding information about how data are related and how they are hierarchically organized expand rapidly. Clustering analysis is becoming more and more difficult to be applied on very large amounts of data since the results of these algorithms cannot be efficiently visualized. Most of the available visualization tools that are able to represent such hierarchies, project data in 2D and are lacking often the necessary user friendliness and interactivity. For example, the current phylogenetic tree visualization tools are not able to display easy to understand large scale trees with more than a few thousand nodes. In this study, we review tools that are currently available for the visualization of biological trees and analysis, mainly developed during the last decade. We describe the uniform and standard computer readable formats to represent tree hierarchies and we comment on the functionality and the limitations of these tools. We also discuss on how these tools can be developed further and should become integrated with various data sources. Here we focus on freely available software that offers to the users various tree-representation methodologies for biological data analysis.},

	abstract = {Over the history of mankind, textual records change. Sometimes due to mistakes during transcription, sometimes on purpose, as a way to rewrite facts and reinterpret history. There are several classical cases, such as the logarithmic tables, and the transmission of antique and medieval scholarship. Today, text documents are largely edited and redistributed on the Web. Articles on news portals and collaborative platforms (such as Wikipedia), source code, posts on social networks, and even scientific publications or literary works are some examples in which textual content can be subject to changes in an evolutionary process. In this scenario, given a set of near-duplicate documents, it is worthwhile to find which one is the original and the history of changes that created the whole set. Such functionality would have immediate applications on news tracking services, detection of plagiarism, textual criticism, and copyright enforcement, for instance. However, this is not an easy task, as textual features pointing to the documents’ evolutionary direction may not be evident and are often dataset dependent. Moreover, side information, such as time stamps, are neither always available nor reliable. In this paper, we propose a framework for reliably reconstructing text phylogeny trees, and seamlessly exploring new approaches on a wide range of scenarios of text reusage. We employ and evaluate distinct combinations of dissimilarity measures and reconstruction strategies within the proposed framework, and evaluate each approach with extensive experiments, including a set of artificial near-duplicate documents with known phylogeny, and from documents collected from Wikipedia, whose modifications were made by Internet users. We also present results from qualitative experiments in two different applications: text plagiarism and reconstruction of evolutionary trees for manuscripts (stemmatology).},

	shorttitle = {{SEPP}},
	abstract = {We address the problem of Phylogenetic Placement, in which the objective is to insert short molecular sequences (called query sequences) into an existing phylogenetic tree and alignment on full-length sequences for the same gene. Phylogenetic placement has the potential to provide information beyond pure "species identification" (i.e., the association of metagenomic reads to existing species), because it can also give information about the evolutionary relationships between these query sequences and to known species. Approaches for phylogenetic placement have been developed that operate in two steps: first, an alignment is estimated for each query sequence to the alignment of the full-length sequences, and then that alignment is used to find the optimal location in the phylogenetic tree for the query sequence. Recent methods of this type include HMMALIGN+EPA, HMMALIGN+pplacer, and PaPaRa+EPA.We report on a study evaluating phylogenetic placement methods on biological and simulated data. This study shows that these methods have extremely good accuracy and computational tractability under conditions where the input contains a highly accurate alignment and tree for the full-length sequences, and the set of full-length sequences is sufficiently small and not too evolutionarily diverse; however, we also show that under other conditions accuracy declines and the computational requirements for memory and time exceed acceptable limits. We present SEPP, a general "boosting" technique to improve the accuracy and/or speed of phylogenetic placement techniques. The key algorithmic aspect of this booster is a dataset decomposition technique in SATé, a method that utilizes an iterative divide-and-conquer technique to co-estimate alignments and trees on large molecular sequence datasets. We show that SATé-boosting improves HMMALIGN+pplacer, placing short sequences more accurately when the set of input sequences has a large evolutionary diameter and produces placements of comparable accuracy in a fraction of the time for easier cases. SEPP software and the datasets used in this study are all available for free at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/sepp/submission.},

	abstract = {Lepidopteran stemborers are among the most damaging agricultural pests worldwide, able to reduce crop yields by up to 40\%. Sugarcane is the world’s most prolific crop, and several stemborer species from the families Noctuidae, Tortricidae, Crambidae and Pyralidae attack sugarcane. Australia is currently free of the most damaging stemborers, but biosecurity efforts are hampered by the difficulty in morphologically distinguishing stemborer species. Here we assess the utility of DNA barcoding in identifying stemborer pest species. We review the current state of the COI barcode sequence library for sugarcane stemborers, assembling a dataset of 1297 sequences from 64 species. Sequences were from specimens collected and identified in this study, downloaded from BOLD or requested from other authors. We performed species delimitation analyses to assess species diversity and the effectiveness of barcoding in this group. Seven species exhibited {\textless}0.03 K2P interspecific diversity, indicating that diagnostic barcoding will work well in most of the studied taxa. We identified 24 instances of identification errors in the online database, which has hampered unambiguous stemborer identification using barcodes. Instances of very high within-species diversity indicate that nuclear markers (e.g. 18S, 28S) and additional morphological data (genitalia dissection of all lineages) are needed to confirm species boundaries.},

We used mitochondrial DNA phylogeography (COI) and ecological niche modelling (ENM) to identify LGM refugia for the mycophagous beetle Agyrtodes labralis (Leiodidae), a forest edge species widely distributed in the South Island. Both the phylogenetic analyses and the ENM indicate that A. labralis refuged in Kaikoura, Nelson, and along much of the South Island’s west coast. Phylogeography of this species indicates that recolonization of the largely deforested east and southeast South Island occurred in a west–east direction, with populations moving through the Southern Alps, and that the northern refugia participated little in interglacial population expansion. This contradicts published studies of other New Zealand species, in which recolonization occurs in a north–south fashion from many of the same refugia.},

	shorttitle = {{SEPP}},
	abstract = {We address the problem of Phylogenetic Placement, in which the objective is to insert short molecular sequences (called query sequences) into an existing phylogenetic tree and alignment on full-length sequences for the same gene. Phylogenetic placement has the potential to provide information beyond pure "species identification" (i.e., the association of metagenomic reads to existing species), because it can also give information about the evolutionary relationships between these query sequences and to known species. Approaches for phylogenetic placement have been developed that operate in two steps: first, an alignment is estimated for each query sequence to the alignment of the full-length sequences, and then that alignment is used to find the optimal location in the phylogenetic tree for the query sequence. Recent methods of this type include HMMALIGN+EPA, HMMALIGN+pplacer, and PaPaRa+EPA.We report on a study evaluating phylogenetic placement methods on biological and simulated data. This study shows that these methods have extremely good accuracy and computational tractability under conditions where the input contains a highly accurate alignment and tree for the full-length sequences, and the set of full-length sequences is sufficiently small and not too evolutionarily diverse; however, we also show that under other conditions accuracy declines and the computational requirements for memory and time exceed acceptable limits. We present SEPP, a general "boosting" technique to improve the accuracy and/or speed of phylogenetic placement techniques. The key algorithmic aspect of this booster is a dataset decomposition technique in SATé, a method that utilizes an iterative divide-and-conquer technique to co-estimate alignments and trees on large molecular sequence datasets. We show that SATé-boosting improves HMMALIGN+pplacer, placing short sequences more accurately when the set of input sequences has a large evolutionary diameter and produces placements of comparable accuracy in a fraction of the time for easier cases. SEPP software and the datasets used in this study are all available for free at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/sepp/submission.},

	abstract = {Flies are one of four superradiations of insects (along with beetles, wasps, and moths) that account for the majority of animal life on Earth. Diptera includes species known for their ubiquity (Musca domestica house fly), their role as pests (Anopheles gambiae malaria mosquito), and their value as model organisms across the biological sciences (Drosophila melanogaster). A resolved phylogeny for flies provides a framework for genomic, developmental, and evolutionary studies by facilitating comparisons across model organisms, yet recent research has suggested that fly relationships have been obscured by multiple episodes of rapid diversification. We provide a phylogenomic estimate of fly relationships based on molecules and morphology from 149 of 157 families, including 30 kb from 14 nuclear loci and complete mitochondrial genomes combined with 371 morphological characters. Multiple analyses show support for traditional groups (Brachycera, Cyclorrhapha, and Schizophora) and corroborate contentious findings, such as the anomalous Deuterophlebiidae as the sister group to all remaining Diptera. Our findings reveal that the closest relatives of the Drosophilidae are highly modified parasites (including the wingless Braulidae) of bees and other insects. Furthermore, we use micro-RNAs to resolve a node with implications for the evolution of embryonic development in Diptera. We demonstrate that flies experienced three episodes of rapid radiation—lower Diptera (220 Ma), lower Brachycera (180 Ma), and Schizophora (65 Ma)—and a number of life history transitions to hematophagy, phytophagy, and parasitism in the history of fly evolution over 260 million y.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial genomes provide a promising new tool for understanding deep-level insect phylogenetics, but have yet to be evaluated for their ability to resolve intraordinal relationships. We tested the utility of mitochondrial genome data for the resolution of relationships within Diptera, the insect order for which the most data are available. We sequenced an additional three genomes, from a syrphid, nemestrinid and tabanid, representing three additional dipteran clades, ‘aschiza’, non-heteroneuran muscomorpha and ‘basal brachyceran’, respectively. We assessed the influence of optimality criteria, gene inclusion/exclusion, data recoding and partitioning strategies on topology and nodal support within Diptera. Our consensus phylogeny of Diptera was largely consistent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses of the order, except that we did not recover a monophyletic Muscomorpha (Nesmestrinidae grouped with Tabanidae) or Acalyptratae (Drosophilidae grouped with Calliphoridae). The results were very robust to optimality criteria, as parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian approaches yielded very similar topologies, although nodal support varied. The addition of ribosomal and transfer RNA genes to the protein coding genes traditionally used in mitochondrial genome phylogenies improved the resolution and support, contrary to previous suggestions that these genes would evolve too quickly or prove too difficult to align to provide phylogenetic signal at deep nodes. Strategies to recode data, aimed at reducing homoplasy, resulted in a decrease in tree resolution and branch support. Bayesian analyses were highly sensitive to partitioning strategy: biologically realistic partitions into codon groups produced the best results. The implications of this study for dipteran systematics and the effective approaches to using mitochondrial genome data are discussed. Mitochondrial genomes resolve intraordinal relationships within Diptera accurately over very wide time ranges (1–200 million years ago) and genetic distances, suggesting that this may be an excellent data source for deep-level studies within other, less studied, insect orders.},

The major lineages within the order are well established, and we summarize major recent phylogenetic analyses in a supertree for the Diptera.  Most studies concur that the traditional subordinal group Nematocera is paraphyletic, but relationships between the major lineages of these flies are not recovered consistently.  There is particular instability around the placement of the tipulids and their relatives and the families of the Psychodomorpha as traditionally defined.  The other major suborder, Brachycera, is clearly monophyletic, and the relationships between major brachyceran lineages have become clearer in recent decades.  The Eremoneura, Cyclorrhapha, Schizophora and Calyptrata are monophyletic, however the “Orthorrhapha” and “Aschiza” are paraphyletic, and it is likely that the “Acalyptrata” are also.  Ongoing phylogenetic analyses that span the diversity of the order shall establish a robust phylogeny of the group with increased quantitative rigor.  This will enable a more precise understanding of the evolution of the morphology, biogeography, biology, and physiology of flies.},

Sequencing technologies become cheaper and easier to use and, thus, large-scale evolutionary studies towards the origins of life for all species and their evolution becomes more and more challenging. Databases holding information about how data are related and how they are hierarchically organized expand rapidly. Clustering analysis is becoming more and more difficult to be applied on very large amounts of data since the results of these algorithms cannot be efficiently visualized. Most of the available visualization tools that are able to represent such hierarchies, project data in 2D and are lacking often the necessary user friendliness and interactivity. For example, the current phylogenetic tree visualization tools are not able to display easy to understand large scale trees with more than a few thousand nodes. In this study, we review tools that are currently available for the visualization of biological trees and analysis, mainly developed during the last decade. We describe the uniform and standard computer readable formats to represent tree hierarchies and we comment on the functionality and the limitations of these tools. We also discuss on how these tools can be developed further and should become integrated with various data sources. Here we focus on freely available software that offers to the users various tree-representation methodologies for biological data analysis.},

	abstract = {The order Diptera (true flies) is one of the most species-rich and ecologically diverse clades of insects. The order probably arose in the Permian, and the main lineages of flies were present in the Triassic. A novel recent proposal suggests that Strepsiptera are the sister-order to Diptera. Within Diptera, evidence is convincing for the monophyly of Culicomorpha, Blephariceromorpha, and Tipulomorpha but weak for the monophyly of the other basal infraorders and for the relationships among them. The lower Diptera (Nematocera) is paraphyletic with respect to Brachycera, and morphological evidence suggests the sister-group of Brachycera lies in the Psychodomorpha. Recent analyses suggest Tipulomorpha are closer to the base of Brachycera than to the base of Diptera. Brachycera are undoubtedly monophyletic, but relationships between the basal lineages of this group are poorly understood. The monophyly of Stratiomyomorpha, Xylophagomorpha, Tabanomorpha, and Muscomorpha is well supported. Eremoneura, and its constituent clades Empidoidea and Cyclorrhapha, are monophyletic. The sister-group of Eremoneura is likely to be part or all of Asiloidea. Several viewpoints on the homology of the male genitalia of eremoneuran flies are discussed. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that lower Cyclorrhapha (Aschiza) are paraphyletic; however, schizophoran monophyly is well supported. The monophyly of Acalyptratae is not well-founded and the relationships between acalyptrate superfamilies remain obscure. Recent advances document the monophyly of the families of Calyptratae and the relationships among them. Areas critical to future advances in understanding dipteran phylogeny include the relationships among the basal infraorders of Diptera and Brachycera and the relationships between the superfamilies of acalyptrates. Progress in dipteran phylogenetics will accelerate with the exploration of novel data sources and the formulation of hypotheses in an explicitly quantitative framework.},

We compiled nearly 1 million CO1 barcode sequences appropriate for classifying arthropods and chordates. Compared to our previous Insecta classifier, the current classifier has more than three times the taxonomic coverage, including outgroups, and is based on almost five times as many reference sequences. Unlike other popular rDNA metabarcoding markers, we show that classification performance is similar across the length of the CO1 barcoding region. We show that the RDP classifier can make taxonomic assignments about 19 times faster than the popular top BLAST hit method and reduce the false positive rate from nearly 100\% to 34\%. This is especially important in large-scale biodiversity and biomonitoring studies where datasets can become very large and the taxonomic assignment problem is not trivial. We also show that reference databases are becoming more representative of current species diversity but that gaps still exist. We suggest that it would benefit the field as a whole if all investigators involved in metabarocoding studies, through collaborations with taxonomic experts, also planned to barcode representatives of their local biota as a part of their projects.},

Some of the most commonly used metagenomic classification methods do not provide a measure of confidence for the taxonomic assignments they provide. The aim of this study was to use a naïve Bayesian classifier (Wang et al.
Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 2007; 73: 5261) to automate taxonomic assignments for large batches of insect COI sequences such as data obtained from high-throughput environmental sequencing. This method provides rank-flexible taxonomic assignments with an associated bootstrap support value, and it is faster than the blast-based methods commonly used in environmental sequence surveys. We have developed and rigorously tested the performance of three different training sets using leave-one-out cross-validation, two field data sets, and targeted testing of Lepidoptera, Diptera and Mantodea sequences obtained from the Barcode of Life Data system. We found that type I error rates, incorrect taxonomic assignments with a high bootstrap support, were already relatively low but could be lowered further by ensuring that all query taxa are actually present in the reference database. Choosing bootstrap support cut-offs according to query length and summarizing taxonomic assignments to more inclusive ranks can also help to reduce error while retaining the maximum number of assignments. Additionally, we highlight gaps in the taxonomic and geographic representation of insects in public sequence databases that will require further work by taxonomists to improve the quality of assignments generated using any method.},

Multiple hypotheses based on morphology have been proposed to identify the earliest lineages of flies and place the phylogenetic origin of the higher flies (Brachycera), but convincing support is limited. Here we resolve relationships among the major groups of lower Diptera using sequence data from four nuclear markers, including both ribosomal (28S rDNA) and protein-coding (CAD, TPI and PGD) genes. Our results support both novel and traditional arrangements. Most unexpectedly, the small, highly-specialized family Deuterophlebiidae appears to be sister to all remaining Diptera. Other results include the resolution of the traditional infra-orders Culicomorpha (including a novel superfamily Simulioidea = Thaumaleidae + Simuliidae), Tipulomorpha (Tipulidae sensu lato + Trichoceridae) and Bibionomorpha sensu lato. We find support for a limited Psychodomorpha (Blephariceridae, Tanyderidae and Psychodidae) and Ptychopteromorpha (Ptychopteridae), whereas the placement of several enigmatic families (Nymphomyiidae, Axymyiidae and Perissommatidae) remains ambiguous. According to genetic data, the infra-order Bibionomorpha is sister to the Brachycera. Much of the phylogenetic signal for major lineages was found in the 28S rDNA gene, whereas protein-coding genes performed variably at different levels. In addition to elucidating relationships, we also estimate the age of major lower dipteran clades, based on molecular divergence time estimates using relaxed-clock Bayesian methods and fossil calibration points.},

One underlying reason for this lies in the confusion that often exists between species discovery and specimen identification, and this is reflected in the way that hypotheses are generated and tested. Although these aims can be associated, they are quite distinct and require different methodological approaches, but their conflation has led to the frequently inappropriate use of commonly used analytical methods such as neighbour-joining trees, bootstrap resampling and fixed distance thresholds. Furthermore, the misidentification of voucher specimens can also have serious implications for end users of reference libraries such as the Barcode of Life Data Systems, and in this regard we advocate increased diligence in the a priori identification of specimens to be used for this purpose. This commentary provides an assessment of seven deficiencies that we identify as common in the DNA barcoding literature, and outline some potential improvements for its adaptation and adoption towards more reliable and accurate outcomes.},

Here, we review the use of eDNA metabarcoding for surveying animal and plant richness, and the challenges in using eDNA approaches to estimate relative abundance. We highlight eDNA applications in freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments, and in this broad context, we distill what is known about the ability of different eDNA sample types to approximate richness in space and across time. We provide guiding questions for study design and discuss the eDNA metabarcoding workflow with a focus on primers and library preparation methods. We additionally discuss important criteria for consideration of bioinformatic filtering of data sets, with recommendations for increasing transparency. Finally, looking to the future, we discuss emerging applications of eDNA metabarcoding in ecology, conservation, invasion biology, biomonitoring, and how eDNA metabarcoding can empower citizen science and biodiversity education.},

Recent work has suggested that a DNA-based identification system, founded on the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI), can aid the resolution of this diversity. While past work has validated the ability of COI sequences to diagnose species in certain taxonomic groups, the present study extends these analyses across the animal kingdom. The results indicate that sequence divergences at COI regularly enable the discrimination of closely allied species in all animal phyla except the Cnidaria. This success in species diagnosis reflects both the high rates of sequence change at COI in most animal groups and constraints on intraspecific mitochondrial DNA divergence arising, at least in part, through selective sweeps mediated via interactions with the nuclear genome.},

	abstract = {The correct application of the scientific names of species is neither easy nor trivial. Mistakes can lead to the wrong interpretation of research results or, when pest species are involved, inappropriate regulations and limits on trade, and possibly quarantine failures that permit the invasion of new pest species. Names are particularly challenging to manage when groups of organisms encompass a large number of species, when different workers employ different philosophical views, or when species are in a state of taxonomic flux. The fruit fly tribe Dacini is a species-rich taxon within Tephritidae and contains around a fifth of all known species in the family. About 10\% of the 932 currently recognized species are pests of commercial fruits and vegetables, precipitating quarantines and trade embargos. Authoritative species lists consist largely of scattered regional treatments and outdated online resources. The checklist presented here is the first global overview of valid species names for the Dacini in almost two decades, and includes new lure records. By publishing this list both in paper and digitally, we aim to provide a resource for those studying fruit flies as well as researchers studying components of their impact on agriculture. The list is largely a consolidation of previous works, but following the results from recent phylogenetic work, we transfer one subgenus and eight species to different genera: members of the Bactrocera
subgenus
Javadacus Hardy, considered to belong to the Zeugodacus group of subgenera, are transferred to genus Zeugodacus; Bactrocera
pseudocucurbitae White, 1999, stat. rev., is transferred back to Bactrocera from Zeugodacus; Zeugodacus

Dacini is one of the most diverse tribes of tephritid flies and contains many economically important pest species. Their black and yellow patterned body markings are presumed to act as wasp mimicry, and the characters separating species and groups are limited and in some cases phenotypically plastic. The traditional taxonomy of the tribe is controversial because groupings are based on unique combinations of morphological characters without the use of cladistic methods, though recent phylogenetic and taxonomic analyses have resulted in significant changes to their taxonomy. The monophyly of the three largest genera in the tribe has been tested with only small numbers of representatives per genus and a limited number of genes. To further understand the taxonomy and evolution of Dacini we sequenced seven genes from 167 Dacini species and five dipteran outgroups to construct a robust phylogeny and test phylogenetic relationships between genera, subgenera, and species complexes. Our phylogeny confirms the monophyly of Dacus, Bactrocera, and Zeugodacus. However, most groups below the genus level are not monophyletic, and only through further revision will we be able to understand their evolution and clarify the taxonomy within this tribe.},

It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.},

	abstract = {While phylogeographic structure has been examined in many North American vertebrate species, insects have received much less attention despite their central ecological roles. The moth genus Malacosoma (Hübner, 1820), is an important group of forestry pests responsible for large-scale defoliation across much of the Nearctic and Palearctic. The present study uses sequence variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene to examine the population genetic structure of the three widespread Malacosoma species (M. americana, M. californica, and M. disstria). Populations of all three species showed highest diversity in the south, suggesting that modern populations derived from southern refugia with loss of variation as these lineages dispersed northwards. However, despite similar life histories and dispersal abilities, the extent of regional variation varied among the taxa. M. americana, a species restricted to eastern North America, showed much less genetic structure than the western M. californica or the widespread M. disstria. The regional differentiation in the latter reflects the likely derivation of modern lineages from several refugia, as well as taxonomic uncertainty in M. californica. In these respects, the three species of Malacosoma share phylogeographic patterns similar to those detected in vertebrates which are characterised by greater phylogeographic breaks in the western half of the continent and limited structure in the east.},

However, its population genetic structure and demography are little known. Here, we used mitochondrial ND2 gene to examine the population genetics and phylogeographical structure of C. kiangsu across its distribution range. To test for hierarchical population genetic structure in C. kiangsu, we performed analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) in ARLEQUIN; the median-joining network was generated for all haplotypes by using software Network; phylogeny of all haplotypes was reconstructed by using Neighbour-joining (NJ) in MEGA and maximumlikelihood (ML) in PAUP. Our results showed none significant values of the population genetic structure for C. kiangsu. Phylogenetic analyses exhibited some shallow genealogy, which were corresponding to networks of C. kiangsu haplotypes. All the analysis results did not divide the bamboo locust haplotypes into independent groups. High gene flow together with a recent and sudden population expansion characterized the population structure of this species. Populations of this species are most likely originated in the FJ, HR and TY locations. The Wuyi and Qingling mountains coupled with other mountains in southern China were not effective barriers limiting gene exchange between neighbouring populations on both sides of these mountains.},

Samples from six wild populations covering most of the species range were compared for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit gene (COI). Molecular diversity indices show overall high mtDNA diversity for the populations, but low nucleotide divergence between haplotypes. Our results indicate relatively little geographic population structure, despite the extensive distributional range and expected limited gene flow between populations. We implemented neutrality tests to assess signatures of recent historical demographic events. Tajima’s D test and Fu’s FS test both suggested recent population growth for the populations. The results were only significant for the southernmost populations when applying Tajima’s D, but Fu’s FS indicated significant deviations from neutrality for all populations except the one closest to the equator. Based on our own findings and those from pollen and vegetation studies, we hypothesize that the species range of B. anynana was reduced to equatorial refugia during the last glacial period, and that the species expanded southwards during the past 10,000 years. These results provide crucial background information for studies of phenotypic and molecular adaptation in wild populations of B. anynana.},

Phylogeographic studies concerning the entire region are still rare. Here, we compared global phylogeographic patterns of one boreo-montane and one boreo-temperate butterflies with largely overlapping distribution ranges across the Northern Hemisphere, but with different levels of range fragmentation and food specialization. We reconstructed the global phylogeographic history of the boreo-montane specialist Boloria eunomia (n = 223) and of the boreo-temperate generalist Boloria selene (n = 106) based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers, and with species distribution modelling (SDM). According to the genetic structures obtained, both species show a Siberian origin and considerable split among populations from Nearctic and Palaearctic regions. According to SDMs and molecular data, both butterflies could inhabit vast areas during the moderate glacials. In the case of B. selene, high haplotype diversity and low geographic structure suggest long-lasting interconnected gene flow among populations. A stronger geographic structuring between populations was identified in the specialist B. eunomia, presumably due to the less widespread, heterogeneously distributed food resources, associated with cooler and more humid climatic conditions. Populations of both species show opposite patterns across major parts of North America and in the case of B. eunomia also across Asia. Our data underline the relevance to cover entire distribution ranges to reconstruct the correct phylogeographic history of species.},

It computes several summary statistics from populations or groups of populations, performs input file conversions for other population genetic programs and implements locus-by-locus and multilocus versions of two clustering algorithms to study the genetic structure of populations. The toolbox also includes two Matlab and r functions, Gdispal and Gdivpal, to display differentiation and diversity patterns across landscapes. These functions aim to generate interpolating surfaces based on multilocus distance and diversity indices. In the case of multiple loci, such surfaces can represent a useful alternative to multiple pie charts maps traditionally used in phylogeography to represent the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. These coloured surfaces can also be used to compare different data sets or different diversity and/or distance measures estimated on the same data set.},

This approach has some problems such as how to quantify alternative links among sequences or how to plot efficiently networks to compare them easily. In this paper, a new method is presented: the randomized minimum spanning tree method, based on randomizing the input order of the data in order to produce alternative branchings in the haplotype network. It is shown that this new method can produce, at least in some situations, networks with less alternative links than the minimum spanning network method. A new graphical display of haplotype networks is introduced here. This is based on calculating the coordinates of the haplotypes from a multidimensional scaling of the haplotype distance matrix. The display can be done in two or three dimensions. The eigenvalues extracted from the multidimensional scaling analysis give an indication of the relevant number of dimensions. These tools are illustrated with the analyses of published data on the leopard and on the jaguar. These analyses show interesting and contrasting patterns between these two species of big cats. All tools are implemented in R and available in the package pegas.},

A network graph is probably more appropriate than a strict consensus tree if many alternative, equally most parsimonious, genealogies are to be included. Within the maximum parsimony framework, current phylogenetic inference and network-building algorithms are both unable to guarantee the finding of all most parsimonious (MP) connections. In fact, each approach can find MP connections that the other does not. Although it should be possible to improve at least the maximum parsimony approach, current implementations of these algorithms are such that it is advisable to use both approaches to increase the probability of finding all possible MP connections among a set of DNA sequences.},

	abstract = {Background
The aim of this study is to describe the major evolutionary historical events among Leishmania, sandflies, and the associated animal reservoirs in detail, in accordance with the geographical evolution of the Earth, which has not been previously discussed on a large scale.

Methodology and Principal Findings
Leishmania and sandfly classification has always been a controversial matter, and the increasing number of species currently described further complicates this issue. Despite several hypotheses on the origin, evolution, and distribution of Leishmania and sandflies in the Old and New World, no consistent agreement exists regarding dissemination of the actors that play roles in leishmaniasis. For this purpose, we present here three centuries of research on sandflies and Leishmania descriptions, as well as a complete description of Leishmania and sandfly fossils and the emergence date of each Leishmania and sandfly group during different geographical periods, from 550 million years ago until now. We discuss critically the different approaches that were used for Leishmana and sandfly classification and their synonymies, proposing an updated classification for each species of Leishmania and sandfly. We update information on the current distribution and dispersion of different species of Leishmania (53), sandflies (more than 800 at genus or subgenus level), and animal reservoirs in each of the following geographical ecozones: Palearctic, Nearctic, Neotropic, Afrotropical, Oriental, Malagasy, and Australian. We propose an updated list of the potential and proven sandfly vectors for each Leishmania species in the Old and New World. Finally, we address a classical question about digenetic Leishmania evolution: which was the first host, a vertebrate or an invertebrate?

Conclusions and Significance
We propose an updated view of events that have played important roles in the geographical dispersion of sandflies, in relation to both the Leishmania species they transmit and the animal reservoirs of the parasites.},

	abstract = {Background
Evolutionary trees are central to a wide range of biological studies. In many of these studies, tree nodes and branches need to be associated (or annotated) with various attributes. For example, in studies concerned with organismal relationships, tree nodes are associated with taxonomic names, whereas tree branches have lengths and oftentimes support values. Gene trees used in comparative genomics or phylogenomics are usually annotated with taxonomic information, genome-related data, such as gene names and functional annotations, as well as events such as gene duplications, speciations, or exon shufflings, combined with information related to the evolutionary tree itself. The data standards currently used for evolutionary trees have limited capacities to incorporate such annotations of different data types.

Results
We developed a XML language, named phyloXML, for describing evolutionary trees, as well as various associated data items. PhyloXML provides elements for commonly used items, such as branch lengths, support values, taxonomic names, and gene names and identifiers. By using "property" elements, phyloXML can be adapted to novel and unforeseen use cases. We also developed various software tools for reading, writing, conversion, and visualization of phyloXML formatted data.

Conclusion
PhyloXML is an XML language defined by a complete schema in XSD that allows storing and exchanging the structures of evolutionary trees as well as associated data. More information about phyloXML itself, the XSD schema, as well as tools implementing and supporting phyloXML, is available at .},

Each of the three approaches presents a different viewpoint on phylogeography, most fundamentally how we view the relationship between the inferred history of the sample and the history of the population the sample is embedded in. Satisfactory resolution of this relationship between history of the tree and history of the population remains a challenge for all but the most trivial models of phylogeographic processes.

	abstract = {Background
Comparative phylogeography enables the study of historical and evolutionary processes that have contributed to shaping patterns of contemporary genetic diversity across co-distributed species. In this study, we explored genetic structure and historical demography in a range of coastal marine species across the northeast Atlantic to assess whether there are commonalities in phylogeographic patterns across taxa and to evaluate whether the timings of population expansions were linked to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

Methods
A literature search was conducted using Web of Science. Search terms were chosen to maximise the inclusion of articles reporting on population structure and phylogeography from the northeast Atlantic; titles and abstracts were screened to identify suitable articles within the scope of this study. Given the proven utility of mtDNA in comparative phylogeography and the availability of these data in the public domain, a meta-analysis was conducted using published mtDNA gene sequences. A standardised methodology was implemented to ensure that the genealogy and demographic history of all mtDNA datasets were reanalysed in a consistent and directly comparable manner.

Results
Mitochondrial DNA datasets were built for 21 species. The meta-analysis revealed significant population differentiation in 16 species and four main types of haplotype network were found, with haplotypes in some species unique to specific geographical locations. A signal of rapid expansion was detected in 16 species, whereas five species showed evidence of a stable population size. Corrected mutation rates indicated that the majority of expansions were estimated to have occurred after the earliest estimate for the LGM (∼26.5 Kyr), while few expansions were estimated to have pre-dated the LGM.

Conclusion
This study suggests that post-LGM expansion appeared to be common in a range of marine taxa, supporting the concept of rapid expansions after the LGM as the ice sheets started to retreat. However, despite the commonality of expansion patterns in many of these taxa, phylogeographic patterns appear to differ in the species included in this study. This suggests that species-specific evolutionary processes, as well as historical events, have likely influenced the distribution of genetic diversity of marine taxa in the northeast Atlantic.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the spatial scale of population connectivity is important for understanding the evolutionary potential of ecologically divergent populations and for designing conservation strategies to preserve those populations. For marine organisms like fish, the spatial scale of connectivity is generally set by a pelagic larval phase. This has complicated past estimates of connectivity because detailed information on larval movements are difficult to obtain. Genetic approaches provide a tractable alternative and have the added benefit of estimating directly the reproductive isolation of populations. In this study, we leveraged empirical estimates of genetic differentiation among populations with simulations and a meta-analysis to provide a general estimate of the spatial scale of genetic connectivity in marine environments. We used neutral genetic markers to first quantify the genetic differentiation of ecologically-isolated adult populations of a land dwelling fish, the Pacific leaping blenny (Alticus arnoldorum), where marine larval dispersal is the only probable means of connectivity among populations. We then compared these estimates to simulations of a range of marine dispersal scenarios and to collated FST and distance data from the literature for marine fish across diverse spatial scales. We found genetic connectivity at sea was extensive among marine populations and in the case of A. arnoldorum, apparently little affected by the presence of ecological barriers. We estimated that {\textasciitilde}5000 km (with broad confidence intervals ranging from 810–11,692 km) was the spatial scale at which evolutionarily meaningful barriers to gene flow start to occur at sea, although substantially shorter distances are also possible for some taxa. In general, however, such a large estimate of connectivity has important implications for the evolutionary and conservation potential of many marine fish communities.},

	abstract = {Although various computer tools have been elaborately developed to calculate a series of statistics in molecular population genetics for both small- and large-scale DNA data, there is no efficient and easy-to-use toolkit available yet for exclusively focusing on the steps of mathematical calculation. Here, we present PopSc, a bioinformatic toolkit for calculating 45 basic statistics in molecular population genetics, which could be categorized into three classes, including (i) genetic diversity of DNA sequences, (ii) statistical tests for neutral evolution, and (iii) measures of genetic differentiation among populations. In contrast to the existing computer tools, PopSc was designed to directly accept the intermediate metadata, such as allele frequencies, rather than the raw DNA sequences or genotyping results. PopSc is first implemented as the web-based calculator with user-friendly interface, which greatly facilitates the teaching of population genetics in class and also promotes the convenient and straightforward calculation of statistics in research. Additionally, we also provide the Python library and R package of PopSc, which can be flexibly integrated into other advanced bioinformatic packages of population genetics analysis.},

	abstract = {Population genetic statistics from multilocus genotype data inform our understanding of the patterns of genetic variation and their implications for evolutionary studies, generally, and human disease studies in particular. In any given population one can estimate haplotype frequencies, identify deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, test for balancing or directional selection, and investigate patterns of linkage disequilibrium. Existing software packages are oriented primarily toward the computation of such statistics on a population-by-population basis, not on comparisons among populations and across different statistics. We developed PyPop (Python for Population Genomics) to facilitate the analyses of population genetic statistics across populations and the relationships among different statistics within and across populations. PyPop is an open-source framework for performing large-scale population genetic analyses on multilocus genotype data. It computes the statistics described above, among others. PyPop deploys a standard Extensible Markup Language (XML) output format and can integrate the results of multiple analyses on various populations that were performed at different times into a common output format that can be read into a spreadsheet. The XML output format allows PyPop to be embedded as part of a larger analysis pipeline. Originally developed to analyze the highly polymorphic genetic data of the human leukocyte antigen region of the human genome, PyPop has applicability to any kind of multilocus genetic data. It is the primary analysis platform for analyzing data collected for the Anthropological component of the 13th and 14th International Histocompatibility Workshops. PyPop has also been successfully used in studies by our group, with collaborators, and in publications by several independent research teams.},

The primary goal of bioinformatics is to detect useful knowledge hidden under large volumes biological and biomedical data, gain a greater insight into their relationships and, therefore, enhance the discovery and the comprehension of biological processes. To achieve this, a great number of text mining techniques have been developed that efficiently manage and disclose meaningful patterns and correlations from biological and biomedical data repositories. However, as the volume of data grows rapidly these techniques cannot cope with the computational burden that is produced since they apply only in centralized environments. Consequently, a turn into distributed and parallel solutions is indispensable. In the context of this work, we propose an efficient and scalable solution, in the MapReduce framework, for mining and analyzing biological and biomedical data.},

This biological dat/information has necessitated the requirement of computerized databases to store, categorize and index the data as well as to view and analyze the data using specialized tools and algorithms. Feature selection, normalization and standardization of the data, visualization of the results and evaluation of the produced knowledge are equally important steps in the knowledge discovery process. Data mining aims to provide the analysts with novel and efficient computational tools to overcome the constraints posed by the traditional statistical methods. It is used to extract interesting, nontrivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from data. Likewise, bioinformatics is the analysis of accurate and reliable biological information using computers and statistical techniques in order to gain new biological insights. Computers are used to gather, store, analyze and integrate biological and genetic information which can then be applied to gene-based drug discovery and development. This paper will focus on issues related to data mining and relevance of these data base sequences and gene expression in bioinformatics.},

In the third part, graph-based data mining, the focus is on graph-based mining in biological networks. I will discuss how to apply graph-based mining techniques and algorithms in the analysis of modular and hierarchical structure of biological networks, how to identify and evaluate the subnetworks from complicated biological networks, and present the experimental results.

Distances generated under this model then provide the basis for most downstream analyses, but uncertainty in model choice is rarely explored and could potentially affect how reliably DNA barcodes discriminate species. 2. Using information-theoretic approaches for a data set comprising 14 472 DNA barcodes from 14 published studies, we tested whether the K2P model was a good fit at the species level and whether applying a better fitting model biased error rates or changed overall identification success. 3. We report that the K2P was a poorly fitting model at the species level; it was never selected as the best model and very rarely selected as a credible alternative model. Despite the lack of support for the K2P model, differences in distance between best model and K2P model estimates were usually minimal, and importantly, identification success rates were largely unaffected by model choice even when interspecific threshold values were reassessed. 4. Although these conclusions may justify using the K2P model for specimen identification purposes, we found simpler metrics such as p distance performed equally well, perhaps obviating the requirement for model correction in DNA barcoding. Conversely, when incorporating genetic distance data into taxonomic studies, we advocate a more thorough examination of model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Studies examining phylogenetic community structure have become increasingly prevalent, yet little attention has been given to the influence of the input phylogeny on metrics that describe phylogenetic patterns of co-occurrence. Here, we examine the influence of branch length, tree reconstruction method, and amount of sequence data on measures of phylogenetic community structure, as well as the phylogenetic signal (Pagel’s λ) in morphological traits, using Trichoptera larval communities from Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. We find that model-based tree reconstruction methods and the use of a backbone family-level phylogeny improve estimations of phylogenetic community structure. In addition, trees built using the barcode region of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) alone accurately predict metrics of phylogenetic community structure obtained from a multi-gene phylogeny. Input tree did not alter overall conclusions drawn for phylogenetic signal, as significant phylogenetic structure was detected in two body size traits across input trees. As the discipline of community phylogenetics continues to expand, it is important to investigate the best approaches to accurately estimate patterns. Our results suggest that emerging large datasets of DNA barcode sequences provide a vast resource for studying the structure of biological communities.},

Hence, two measures of differentiation can be compared for a single data set: one (GST ) that makes use only of the allelic frequencies and the other (NST ) for which similarities between the haplotypes are taken into account in addition. Tests are proposed to compare NST and GST with zero and with each other. The difference between NST and GST can be caused by several factors, including sampling artefacts, unequal effect of mutation rates and phylogeographic structure. The method presented is applied to a published data set where a nuclear DNA sequence had been determined from individuals of a grasshopper distributed in 24 regions of Europe. Additional insights into the genetic subdivision of these populations are obtained by progressively combining related haplotypes and reanalyzing the data each time.},

Various plotting tools are also provided for a visual evaluation of estimated values, allowing users to critically assess the validity and significance of statistical tests from a biological perspective. diveRsity has a set of unique features, which facilitate the use of an informed framework for assessing the validity of the use of traditional F-statistics for the inference of demography, with reference to specific marker types, particularly focusing on highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. However, the package can be readily used for other co-dominant marker types (e.g. allozymes, SNPs). Detailed examples of usage and descriptions of package capabilities are provided. The examples demonstrate useful strategies for the exploration of data and interpretation of results generated by diveRsity.

	abstract = {Aim Our work seeks to understand the global demographical response of bat species to the climate change that occurred at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Location All continents except Antarctica. Methods Mitochondrial DNA sequences were sampled from bat species throughout the planet where we could associate a georeferenced sample with a given DNA sequence. Our investigation estimates the historical demographical response using over 12,000 samples from {\textgreater}300 nominal species of bats. Custom Python and R scripts were written to aggregate sequence data from GenBank, locality information from GBIF, and to associate these records to individual samples. We conducted approximate Bayesian computation to calculate the posterior probability of demographical bottleneck and expansion responses to the end of the Pleistocene, and then collected organismal trait data to identify traits that were associated with either demographical response. We also used R to estimate current and end-Pleistocene species distribution models (SDM) for species where {\textgreater}10 georeferenced samples were available. Results Analysis of the genetic data indicate that some temperate insectivores responded to the end of the Pleistocene by undergoing a demographical expansion. However, the neotropical family Phyllostomidae experienced the most dramatic response, with many of its species undergoing demographical bottlenecks. Larger bats, and those with shorter forewings, were more likely to undergo a demographical bottleneck. In contrast with the results of the genetic data analysis, the automated SDMs all predicted range expansion since the LGM. Main conclusions Historical populations of Neotropical bats that rely on Angiosperms for resources (i.e., pollen, nectar, fruit) were negatively influenced by the climate change that occurred at the end of the Pleistocene. Our work highlights the utility of incorporating exploratory trait-based analyses in phylogeography. It serves as an example of automated big data phylogeography, and suggests that repurposed data can lead to new insights about global biodiversity.},

	abstract = {An empirical Bayes (EB) pairwise FST estimator was previously introduced and evaluated for its performance by numerical simulation. In this study, we conducted coalescent simulations and generated genetic population structure mechanistically, and compared the performance of the EBFST with Nei's GST, Nei and Chesser's bias-corrected GST (GST\_NC), Weir and Cockerham's θ (θWC) and θ with finite sample correction (θWC\_F). We also introduced EB estimators for Hedrick’ G’ST and Jost’ D. We applied these estimators to publicly available SNP genotypes of Atlantic herring. We also examined the power to detect the environmental factors causing the population structure. Our coalescent simulations revealed that the finite sample correction of θWC is necessary to assess population structure using pairwise FST values. For microsatellite markers, EBFST performed the best among the present estimators regarding both bias and precision under high gene flow scenarios (). For 300 SNPs, EBFST had the highest precision in all cases, but the bias was negative and greater than those for GST\_NC and θWC\_F in all cases. GST\_NC and θWC\_F performed very similarly at all levels of FST. As the number of loci increased up to 10 000, the precision of GST\_NC and θWC\_F became slightly better than for EBFST for cases with , even though the size of the bias remained constant. The EB estimators described the fine-scale population structure of the herring and revealed that 56\% of the genetic differentiation was caused by sea surface temperature and salinity.

Therefore, it is crucial in genetic monitoring and conservation biology to have a reliable estimate of the pattern of population subdivision. FST's for pairs of sampled localities or subpopulations are crucial statistics for the exploratory analysis of population structures, such as cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. However, the estimation of FST is not precise enough to reliably estimate the population structure and the extent of heterogeneity. This article proposes an empirical Bayes procedure to estimate locus-specific pairwise FST's. The posterior mean of the pairwise FST can be interpreted as a shrinkage estimator, which reduces the variance of conventional estimators largely at the expense of a small bias. The global FST of a population generally varies among loci in the genome. Our maximum-likelihood estimates of global FST's can be used as sufficient statistics to estimate the distribution of FST in the genome. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our model by simulation and by an analysis of the microsatellite allele frequencies of the Pacific herring. The heterogeneity of the global FST in the genome is discussed on the basis of the estimated distribution of the global FST for the herring and examples of human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).},

It was not substantially improved in topology until recently when phylogenomics settled many long-standing controversies. Intervening advances came instead through methodological improvement. Early molecular phylogenetic studies (1985–2005), dominated by a few genes, provided datasets that were too small to resolve controversial phylogenetic problems. Adding to the lack of consensus, this period was characterized by a polarization of philosophies, with individuals belonging to either parsimony or maximum-likelihood camps; each largely ignoring the insights of the other. The result was an unfortunate detour in which the few perceived phylogenetic revolutions published by both sides of the philosophical divide were probably erroneous. The size of datasets has been growing exponentially since the mid-1980s accompanied by a wave of confidence that all relationships will soon be known. However, large datasets create new challenges, and a large number of genes does not guarantee reliable results. If history is a guide, then the quality of conclusions will be determined by an improved understanding of both molecular and morphological evolution, and not simply the number of genes analysed.},

A principal argument in favour of these statistics is the independence of their maximal values with respect to the subpopulation heterozygosity HS, a property not shared by FST. Nevertheless, it has been unclear if these alternative differentiation measures are constrained by other aspects of the allele frequencies. Here, for biallelic markers, we study the mathematical properties of the maximal values of and D, comparing them to those of FST. We show that and D exhibit the same peculiar frequency-dependence phenomena as FST, including a maximal value as a function of the frequency of the most frequent allele that lies well below one. Although the functions describing , D, and FST in terms of the frequency of the most frequent allele are different, the allele frequencies that maximize them are identical. Moreover, we show using coalescent simulations that when taking into account the specific maximal values of the three statistics, their behaviours become similar across a large range of migration rates. We use our results to explain two empirical patterns: the similar values of the three statistics among North American wolves, and the low D values compared to and FST in Atlantic salmon. The results suggest that the three statistics are often predictably similar, so that they can make quite similar contributions to data analysis. When they are not similar, the difference can be understood in relation to features of genetic diversity.},

However, taxonomic identifications are often unreliable, especially for non-vascular plants and fungi including lichens, which may lack critical revisions of voucher specimens. Due to the scale of the problem, restudy of millions of collections is unrealistic and other strategies are needed. Here we propose to use verified, georeferenced occurrence data of a given species to apply predictive niche modeling that can then be used to evaluate unverified occurrences of that species. Selecting the charismatic lichen fungus, Usnea longissima, as a case study, we used georeferenced occurrence records based on sequenced specimens to model its predicted niche. Our results suggest that the target species is largely restricted to a narrow range of boreal and temperate forest in the Northern Hemisphere and that occurrence records in GBIF from tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere do not represent this taxon, a prediction tested by comparison with taxonomic revisions of Usnea for these regions. As a novel approach, we employed Principal Component Analysis on the environmental grid data used for predictive modeling to visualize potential ecogeographical barriers for the target species; we found that tropical regions conform a strong barrier, explaining why potential niches in the Southern Hemisphere were not colonized by Usnea longissima and instead by morphologically similar species. This approach is an example of how data from two of the most important biodiversity repositories, GenBank and GBIF, can be effectively combined to remotely address the problem of inaccuracy of taxonomic identifications in occurrence data repositories and to provide a filtering mechanism which can considerably reduce the number of voucher specimens that need critical revision, in this case from 4,672 to about 100.},

	abstract = {Most eukaryotic organisms are arthropods. Yet, their diversity in rich terrestrial ecosystems is still unknown. Here we produce tangible estimates of the total species richness of arthropods in a tropical rainforest. Using a comprehensive range of structured protocols, we sampled the phylogenetic breadth of arthropod taxa from the soil to the forest canopy in the San Lorenzo forest, Panama. We collected 6144 arthropod species from 0.48 hectare and extrapolated total species richness to larger areas on the basis of competing models. The whole 6000-hectare forest reserve most likely sustains 25,000 arthropod species. Notably, just 1 hectare of rainforest yields {\textgreater}60\% of the arthropod biodiversity held in the wider landscape. Models based on plant diversity fitted the accumulated species richness of both herbivore and nonherbivore taxa exceptionally well. This lends credence to global estimates of arthropod biodiversity developed from plant models.
Total arthropod species richness in a tropical rainforest can be best predicted by plant diversity.

Concurrent with the rise in application of MSOMs among ecologists, a quiet regime shift is occurring in Bayesian statistics where predictive model comparison approaches are experiencing a resurgence. Unlike single-species occupancy models that use integrated likelihoods, MSOMs are usually couched in a Bayesian framework and contain multiple levels. Standard model checking and selection methods are often unreliable in this setting and there is only limited guidance in the ecological literature for this class of models. We examined several different contemporary Bayesian hierarchical approaches for checking and validating MSOMs and applied these methods to a freshwater aquatic study system in Colorado, USA, to better understand the diversity and distributions of plains fishes. Our findings indicated distinct differences among model selection approaches, with cross-validation techniques performing the best in terms of prediction.},

	abstract = {Multi-species biodiversity indicators are increasingly used to assess progress towards the 2020 ‘Aichi’ targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity. However, most multi-species indicators are biased towards a few well-studied taxa for which suitable abundance data are available. Consequently, many taxonomic groups are poorly represented in current measures of biodiversity change, particularly invertebrates. Alternative data sources, including opportunistic occurrence data, when analysed appropriately, can provide robust estimates of occurrence over time and increase the taxonomic coverage of such measures of population change. Occupancy modelling has been shown to produce robust estimates of species occurrence and trends through time. So far, this approach has concentrated on well-recorded taxa and performs poorly where recording intensity is low. Here, we show that the use of weakly informative priors in a Bayesian occupancy model framework greatly improves the precision of occurrence estimates associated with current model formulations when analysing low-intensity occurrence data, although estimated trends can be sensitive to the choice of prior when data are extremely sparse at either end of the recording period. Specifically, three variations of a Bayesian occupancy model, each with a different focus on information sharing among years, were compared using British ant data from the Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society and tested in a simulation experiment. Overall, the random walk model, which allows the sharing of information between the current and previous year, showed improved precision and low bias when estimating species occurrence and trends. The use of the model formulation described here will enable a greater range of datasets to be analysed, covering more taxa, which will significantly increase taxonomic representation of measures of biodiversity change.},

In recent years, the field has witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of methods available for delimiting species. However, most recent investigations only utilize a handful (i.e. 2–3) of the available methods, often for unstated reasons. Because the parameter space that is potentially relevant to species delimitation far exceeds the parameterization of any existing method, a given method necessarily makes a number of simplifying assumptions, any one of which could be violated in a particular system. We suggest that researchers should apply a wide range of species delimitation analyses to their data and place their trust in delimitations that are congruent across methods. Incongruence across the results from different methods is evidence of either a difference in the power to detect cryptic lineages across one or more of the approaches used to delimit species and could indicate that assumptions of one or more of the methods have been violated. In either case, the inferences drawn from species delimitation studies should be conservative, for in most contexts it is better to fail to delimit species than it is to falsely delimit entities that do not represent actual evolutionary lineages.},

	abstract = {The focus of this article is a Bayesian method for inferring both species delimitations and species trees under the multispecies coalescent model using molecular sequences from multiple loci. The species delimitation requires no a priori assignment of individuals to species, and no guide tree. The method is implemented in a package called STACEY for BEAST2, and is a extension of the author’s DISSECT package. Here we demonstrate considerable efficiency improvements by using three new operators for sampling from the posterior using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and by using a model for the population size parameters along the branches of the species tree which allows these parameters to be integrated out. The correctness of the moves is demonstrated by tests of the implementation. The practice of using a pipeline approach to species delimitation under the multispecies coalescent, has been shown to have major problems on simulated data (Olave et al. in Syst Biol 63:263–271. doi:10.1093/sysbio/syt106, 2014). The same simulated data set is used to demonstrate the accuracy and improved convergence of the present method. We also compare performance with *BEAST for a fixed delimitation analysis on a large data set, and again show improved convergence.},

Species delimitation within genus is considered to be difficult due to: (a) lack of an efficient key; (b) non-defined taxonomical status of a large number of species; and (c) blurred nomenclature. Here, we present the first molecular study to delimit species of the genus by using a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) gene. We assessed 75 specimens assigned to 28 taxa originating from two biogeographic zones: 22 from the western Palaearctic and six from the Afrotropical region. Two datasets were generated based on different sequence lengths to explore the significance of availability of more polymorphic sites for species delimitation; dataset A with a total length of 647 bp and dataset B with 746 bp. Various tree inference approaches and Poisson tree processes models were applied to evaluate the putative ‘taxonomical’ vs. ‘molecular’ taxa clusters. All analyses resulted in high taxonomic resolution and clear species delimitation for both the dataset lengths. Furthermore, we revealed a high number of mitochondrial haplotypes and high intraspecific variability. We report two major monophyletic clades, and seven ‘molecular’ groups of taxa formed, which are congruent with morphology-based taxonomy. Our results support the use of the mitochondrial COI gene in species diagnosis of Eumerus.},

Location Two rain forest areas 130 km and 1700 altitudinal metres apart were studied in Papua New Guinea: one in the lowlands (100 m a.s.l.) on the northern coast of the island and one in the central New Guinean cordillera at 1800 m a.s.l. Methods The analysis is based on caterpillar feeding records obtained by quantitative sampling and rearing of caterpillars from four Ficus species studied in the mountains and 21 Ficus species and 62 plant species from other genera and families studied in the lowlands, including three Ficus species studied in both areas. Results Only 17\% of species feeding on Ficus in the highlands also occurred in the lowlands. These species represented 1–46\% of individuals in caterpillar assemblages on particular Ficus hosts. Widespread species included both Ficus specialists and generalists feeding on numerous plant families. Some of the Ficus specialists changed their preferred host species with altitude. High species turnover was not explained by changes in the species composition of host plants with altitude as lowland and montane assemblages feeding on the same Ficus species showed high turnover. Despite the rarity of widespread caterpillars, the lowland and montane Ficus assemblages were remarkably similar in their dominance structure, species richness, host specificity, generic composition and familial composition. Main conclusions Ficus-feeding Lepidoptera assemblages between tropical lowlands and highlands are characterized by substantial species turnover not explained by altitudinal changes in the composition of the vegetation. Further, species-rich plant genera can support caterpillar assemblages with relatively low beta-diversity compared with species-poor genera as caterpillars can switch their host preferences from one congeneric host species to another along an altitudinal gradient. Closely related plant species can thus represent a broad, continuously distributed resource along such gradients.},

In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is an increase in trypanosome non-susceptibility to multiple trypanocides, but limited information on judicious trypanocide use is accessible to smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders in disease endemic regions, resulting in widespread multi-drug resistance. Huge economic expenses and the laborious nature of extensive field studies have hindered collection of the requisite large-scale prospective datasets required to inform disease management. We examined the efficacy of community-led data collection strategies using smartphones by smallholder farmers to acquire robust datasets from the trypanosomiasis endemic Shimba hills region in Kenya. We used Open Data Kit, an open-source smartphone application development software, to create a data collection App.

Results
Our study provides proof of concept for the viability of using smartphone Apps to remotely collect reliable large-scale information from smallholder farmers and veterinary health care givers in resource poor settings. We show that these datasets can be reliably collated remotely, analysed, and the findings can inform policies that improve farming practices and economic wellbeing while restricting widespread multi-drug resistance. Moreover, this strategy can be used to monitor and manage other infectious diseases in other rural, resource poor settings.},

	abstract = {Open Education Resources (OER) are geared towards promoting accessibility to education and to help overcome certain constraints to education associated with traditional ways of learning. However, these OERs can only be successfully rolled out and utilised in environments already enjoying certain infrastructural empowerments, including teacher-preparedness, availability of equipment to allow use of OERs and learner exposure and knowhow. This poses a major hurdle in many public and private schools in Kenya, which are in far-flung areas without electricity, mobile-phone connectivity, internet services and serviceable roads that allow movement to a cyber cafe where internet services may be accessed at a fee. These difficulties are encountered by both teachers and their learners. This paper seeks to discuss the challenges faced in implementation of OERs especially by the teachers who are expected to sensitise learners on the availability and utilisation of the OERs, while they themselves are either unaware of them, poorly trained to handle them or are under-facilitated to carry out their mandate. The study was carried out in Tharaka- Nithi County, Kenya. The County was chosen because challenges related to OER have been reported there. The county has 104 secondary schools. A sample size of 45 representing 20\% of the respondents was considered sufficient for the study. A questionnaire was used to obtain data on the teacher ICT competencies, their awareness of and attitudes towards OER and the challenges they teachers faced in implementation of OER. The study found that utilisation of OER stands at about 3\% as a result of ignorance regarding OER or a negative attitude towards them, poor ICT skills amongst the teachers and poor or inadequate resources within and around the schools.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial carbon stock estimates information has signi cant importance in planning decisions for amicable mitigation of global warming and climate change related disasters. However, conventional estimation methods are usually expensive and time demanding particularly on national or regional scales. Therefore, this study sought to estimate and analyze carbon stock changes in Kenya as a consequence of land cover change (LCC) using open data and software to provide a ordable and timely solutions. Using Random Forest (RF) decision trees, the land cover for 2028 was modelled from 2004 and 2016 land cover under Business as Usual (BAU) and an alternative, Reducing of Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation (REDD+) scenarios. The modelled land cover maps were thereafter input in InVEST carbon model for estimation and valuation of carbon stock between 2004 and 2028. The results show a 16\% decline in carbon stock between 2004 and 2028 with a likelihood of losing up to 21 billion US\$ under BAU scenario at a national level. On a regional scale, the results revealed a gradual decline in carbon stock in the Coastal and Central regions of the study area while other regions exhibited mixed results. However, the trend can be reversed by implementation of REDD+ scenario with a possible increase of 1.6\% between 2016 and 2028, translating to a gain of approximately 1 billion US\$. This study contributes to the understanding of spatiotemporal carbon stock changes under di erent scenarios for
e ective spatial planning, land use policy development and keeping balances during natural resource utilization.},

Thus, OSM was used to compute (in the second part of the research) and analyse the road accessibility rate within the buffer zone of two kilometers from human settlements. To locate human settlements, raster data, representing land covers were used. Results are pointing where the infrastructure is not mapped or is not present.

	shorttitle = {Open {Education} {Resources} {Differentiation}},
	abstract = {The academic literature on open educational resources (OER) and practices in higher education has grown substantially over the past decade. OER is seen to offer endless possibilities for Sub-Saharan African universities by reducing costs of education, improving quality of education, as well as increasing access to quality education for all, among others. Sub-Saharan African universities though, are notably underrepresented in the literature, especially on differentiations, be it on access to or use and sharing of OER. This thesis synthesizes research carried out to develop a representative view of OER in three Sub-Saharan countries: Kenya, Ghana and South Africa. The study, which formed part of the Research on Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project, explores differentiation in terms of (i) digital proficiency; (ii) level of use of OER; (iii) awareness of licensing; and (iv) the perceived value of OER. This thesis examines a deliberate selection of twelve universities across the three countries with randomly sampled students and lecturers. Separate questionnaires for students and the lecturers were used, which generated a response from a total of 2249 students and 106 lecturers. Major findings are: (i) that there is a significant digital differentiation among lecturers and students in terms of their proficiency, devices used and internet accessibility; and (ii) that the awareness and appreciation of the OER concept and open licensing is generally low, but from the actual variety and types of processing by respondents of educational resources which may not be open, there is a preparedness towards openness in the future in all the three countries. Therefore, the universities can use these findings in considerating how to restructure their educational policies to incorporate OER in teaching and learning to enhance the quality of education.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1108/LHTN-01-2019-0004},
	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the Africa image and map portal (AIMP) project’s origins and development, along with its applications to date. This paper includes methods and a step-by-step appendix so that the project can be reproduced at other institutions.

Design/methodology/approach
AIMP was created with a suite of free and open source software, including QGIS, Mapbox.js and GitHub. Built around the concept of an interactive index map, AIMP allows for geographic searching of maps, posters and images from Indiana University’s (IU) African Studies collections. This paper presents a case study for the use of this geographic discovery tool at an academic library.

Findings
AIMP has allowed comparison of collection strengths with research interests of IU African Studies affiliates and to make strategic collection development decisions that will best serve the authors’ patrons. The instruction applications of AIMP are also full of potential. To date, the Librarian for African Studies has used the portal to familiarize faculty, as well as undergraduate and graduate students, with the range of image and map resources available to them, in a variety of settings.

Social implications
AIMP allows researchers around the world to discover materials through a geographic search, dramatically connecting and increasing access to and discoverability of these important collections. The use of free and open source geospatial software (foss4g) means that the interface does not rely on an institution’s proprietary software-licensing agreements, making it replicable for other institutions. This use of foss4g widens access to maps, spatial data, images and posters of Africa held by IUL to a global audience.

Originality/value
While interactive index maps are popular among map libraries, AIMP uniquely acts as a discovery portal for a variety of media, including images and posters. In this way, AIMP works to overcome institutional silos and increase discoverability of these important collections to a global audience.},

This paper argues that the African university is uniquely placed to play this new role in today’s technological world and discusses the characteristics and foundational pillars necessary to set up such a program. The arguments provided here challenge Africa to be smart and adopt clever solutions to their data generation, collection and access problems, by finding value and a new role in the intellectuals and institutions of higher learning and in the necessity to involve them in the generation, preservation and sharing of data and knowledge that can be used in the policy formulation process.},

@article{ponelis_diffusion_2018,
	title = {Diffusion of open source integrated library systems in academic libraries in {Africa}},
	issn = {0143-5124},
	abstract = {Purpose
Libraries globally automate their operations and services using integrated library systems (ILS) to increase operational efficiency and meet the ever-evolving demands of their users. Open source ILS (OS ILS) has become more popular globally. The purpose of this paper is to better understand the diffusion of OS ILS in academic libraries in Uganda.

Design/methodology/approach
Rogers’ diffusion of innovation (DoI) supplemented by the fit-viability theory was used as a theoretical framework. A questionnaire was developed based on extant literature and distributed electronically to representative members of a Ugandan university library association.
Findings
The diffusion of OS ILS in Ugandan academic libraries approximates the S-curve expected based on DoI. Ugandan academic libraries are adopting OS ILS for more flexibility to meet changing needs at what is perceived as an affordable cost but not all are fully satisfied. Koha is the most adopted OS ILS and is also being considered by all libraries without any ILS or a proprietary ILS. The information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, organizational procurement policies and national procurement legislation, human resource capacity and limited finances are barriers to diffusion. The total cost of ownership and technical skills required are of particular concern for OS ILS.

Research limitations/implications
The research was limited to a single African country and the recommendations may not be transferable to other African countries. Future research can expand the survey, the countries studied and/or address the methodological limitations of this study.
Practical implications
When embarking upon library automation using OS ILS or migrating to an OS ILS solution libraries should consider their ICT infrastructure, local support community, available training and be realistic about the costs. Local library associations should provide guidance on OS ILS selection, ongoing training, and opportunities for knowledge sharing. LIS schools should consider expanding their curriculum to include library automation and, in Uganda incorporate training on Koha as OS ILS. Libraries and library associations should advocate to reduce restrictive organizational procurement policies and national procurement legislation.

Originality/value
Studies on country-level diffusion of ILS are comparatively few, particularly in African countries. This is the first country-level study of OS ILS diffusion in Uganda. This study can positively impact future patterns of diffusion for optimal deployment of OS ILS software by informing academic libraries, university management, library association, LIS schools, and policymakers in Uganda and across the African continent, and encouraging academics and researchers to teach and study library automation using OS ILS.},

Sharing data potentially contributes the largest, most efficient source of scientific data, but is fraught with contextual challenges which make stakeholders, particularly those in under‐resourced contexts hesitant or slow to share. Relatively little empirical research has engaged stakeholders in discussing the issue. This study sought to explore relevant experiences, contextual, and subjective explanations around the topic to provide a rich and detailed presentation of what it means to different stakeholders and contexts to share data and how that can guide practice and ethical guidance. A qualitative design involving interviews was undertaken with professionals working in public health institutions endowed with data (HDSS), ethics committees, and advisory agencies which help shape health research in Africa. A descriptive form of thematic analysis was used to summarize results into six key themes: (1) The role of HDSSs in research using public health data and data‐sharing; (2) Ownership and funding are critical factors influencing data‐sharing; (3) Other factors discourage data‐sharing; (4) Promoting and sustaining data‐sharing; (5) Ethical guidance structures; and (6) Establishing effective guidance. The themes reveal factors regarding the willingness or not to share and an intricate ethical system that current discourse could reflect. Many of the concerns resonate with the literature, but a whole other gamut of people and process issues; commitments, investments, careers, and the right ethical guidance are needed to realize a sustainable goal of reaching ‘share’ as a default.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Given that repositories were proposed as one of the routes to open access (OA), this study sought to establish the achievements universities in East Africa had attained in initiating institutional repositories (IRs), the challenges in providing OA and strategies for the way forward.

Design/methodology/approach
Data were collected through literature searches, using the internet, journal databases and university websites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for information about OA and IRs in East Africa. Some of the findings were based on the author’s PhD “The management and accessibility of OA IRs in selected universities in East Africa”, which used face-to-face interviews with six librarians and self-administered questionnaires responded to by 183 researchers at Kenyatta University, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and Makerere University.
Findings
Universities in East Africa were still in the intermediate stages of embracing OA, and only 40 libraries out of 145 universities had implemented IRs. However, most of the repositories had less than 1,000 items, with this challenge attributed to the absence of institutional and government/funder mandates that affected the collection/provision of OA, in addition to the lack of awareness of IRs among researchers.

Originality/value
The value in this research was establishing the extent of IR initiatives in universities in East Africa and their contribution to OA, which is regarded as more visible and accessible to scholars and government personnel who could leverage the information for further development in the region.},

And whose mandate is it to ensure that Africa pursues and derives maximum benefits from Open Science? This paper argues that Open Science initiatives should address the challenges faced by the continent and should support national and Africa wide development agendas. Governments should put in place policy frameworks for Open Science and mandate institutions that are coordinating science, technology and innovation (STI) research to lead national Open Science initiatives. Increased public funding for STI research is key to implementing successful Open Science initiatives. Africa is home to several opportunities that could spur investments in research.},

Existing frameworks for studying knowledge production have points of discontinuities that create a lever for excluding knowledge not produced in other mainstream contexts from a global reckoning. Finally, we engage the identified discontinuities and suggest how open access could be made to work in Africa.},

	abstract = {The worldwide slum population currently stands at over one billion, with substantial growth expected in the coming decades. Traditionally, slums have been mapped using information derived mainly from either physical indicators using remote sensing data, or socio-economic indicators using census data. Each data source on its own provides only a partial view of slums, an issue further compounded by data poverty in less-developed countries. To overcome such issues, this paper explores the fusion of traditional with emerging open data sources and data mining tools to identify additional indicators that can be used to detect and map the presence of slums, map their footprint, and map their evolution. Towards this goal, we develop an indicator database for slums using open sources of physical and socio-economic data that can be used to characterize slum settlements. Using this database, we then leverage data mining techniques to identify the most suitable combination of these indicators for mapping slums. Using three cities in Kenya as test cases, results show that the fusion of these data can improve the mapping accuracy of slums. These results suggest that the proposed approach can provide a viable solution to the emerging challenge of monitoring the growth of slums.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (lCTs) use in public and private sectors and the fast growing Internet access, Institutions of higher learning have no choice but to adopt these technologies if they have to be relevant in this information age. This study aimed at examining the organizational determinants affecting the adoption of open source software in institution of higher learning in Kenya with special reference to Inoorero University. The specific objectives of the study were; to find out how organizational size affects the use of OSS, to examine the effect of organizational structure on the adoption of OSS, to assess the effect of organizational culture on the adoption and use of OSS in the institution of higher learning and lastly to assess the role of the management in the adoption of OSS in institution of higher learning in Kenya. The study used descriptive survey in carrying out the investigation. This study adopted comprehensive qualitative analysis where a careful and complete scrutiny and understanding of the situations in the institutions was done. The target population of the study consisted of; students, teaching staff and management at Inoorero University, School of Information Technology who were 500 in total. The study used both the stratified sampling techniques and the simple random sampling in the determination of the sample. A sample of 150 respondents was selected from whom data was collected. The study used the questionnaire to collect the data of which 137 were returned and analysed. The Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient was used to test the reliability of the instruments which yielded a value of 0.891, hence the instruments were considered reliable. The data collected was summarized and presented using both descriptive such as frequencies and percentages and inferential statistics such as the correlation and regression analysis. The results show that the adoption of OSS in the institutions of higher learning was determined by organizational size, organizational structure, role of management and the organizational culture. The correlation analysis showed that organizational size had the highest influence in the adoption of OSS in the learning institution. From the regression analysis it showed that the four factors considered in the study influenced the adoption of OSS by only 22.5\%. The study recommends that if the results of this research are implemented by the government of Kenya they can be beneficial to the students and staff of the university and shall form a basis for more research involving the public and private sectors in Kenya. The results would also help in ensuring quality and standardization of the various educational programs at the university level.},

Open Source Software(OSS) is available in various forms including web servers, Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERPs), Academic management systems and network management systems and the development and uptake of such software by both commercial and non-commercial companies and institutions is still on the rise. The availability of OSS applications for every common type of enterprise, minimal licensing issues and availability of source code as well as ease of access has made the technology even more attractive in learning and teaching of software based courses in institutions of learning. Through embracing this technology, institutions of learning have been able to minimize general operations cost that could have otherwise been incurred in procuring similar proprietary software. Students and teaching staff can nowadays interact and modify the readily available source code hence making learning and teaching more practical.},

	shorttitle = {Open source web based spatial information system for monitoring and evaluating of development projects case study},
	abstract = {Web based Geographic Information System has added a new dimension on how spatial information is shared, displayed, processed and disseminated in an easy and quick way which in turn assists different decision makers and stakeholders interested in spatial related development projects. On the other hand, the use of Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) software presents a cost-effective means of implementing, operating and maintaining spatial information over the web with the similar capabilities and features of commercial GIS software. The County Government of Vihiga has embarked on a governance transformation aimed at having development activities (from design, planning, implementation to monitoring and evaluation) undertaken on a GIS platform. Until recently, no effort had been made to spatially make available, on a web platform, development projects to different stakeholders to enable monitoring and evaluation. As part of ensuring different users are able to appreciate the appropriateness of GIS in enhancing Monitoring and evaluation of projects, there is need to develop a user-friendly system for thin clients1 to enable them be part of the daily running of County Government projects as well as ensure accountability by the relevant departments. The main objective of this study is to develop an Open Source Web-based Spatial Information System aimed at providing collection, storage and dissemination of development projects to enable monitoring and evaluation. The methodology adopted in developing the system included User needs assessment and data collection of development projects from the County Government of Vihiga, data analysis and development of a database management system using QGIS and PostgreSQL /PostGIS as the Spatial Database Management System, System used GeoServer as the Map Server, publishing of digital layers as dynamic maps using Open Layers, OpenStreetMap and Google earth and development of an interactive Graphic User Interface framework which is interactive and can perform queries using Node.js. This GUI integrated all the components of the Spatial Information System in one platform easily accessed on a web browser. Scripts and codes were generated using the freely available Javascript Libraries (Open Layers and Node.js). The installation of these libraries involved a HTML (North\_Maragoli.html) document which was a reference to library location in the server system hosted locally. The resultant OpenStreetMap can be embedded into the county website for visualization and thin client spatial analysis. The results of the study was a n working Spatial Information System with capabilities spatial analysis and querying of projects. This system is envisioned to assist the county governments with similar projects in enhancing monitoring and evaluation as well as promote transparency and accountability as they seeks to improve service delivery at the county level. The system has the potential to be scaled up to the World Wide Web level. The availability of this system on the World Wide Web is envisioned encourage multi-stakeholder interaction aimed at facilitating data exchange, stakeholder participation in monitoring and evaluation of projects and improve decision making},

	abstract = {Though the OER movement has been in existence for over a decade now, less has been said on their integration in the academic Libraries. Academic libraries may hold institutional content such as syllabi and past exam papers but Inclusion of lecture notes, presentations, and assessment materials has not been a common practice in the university libraries. It was noted that even if the materials are found in electronic formats these contents remains closed in virtual learning environments and are controlled by the lecturers or the departments providing the course. Their integration with library resources and search facilities including the online public access catalogue (OPAC) is generally insufficient. This project presents a study on the Integration of OER to facilitate teaching and learning in Kenya. To realize this the study sought to examine the available OER integration strategies in the selected academic libraries, assess the type of OER’s integrated in the academic libraries, establish the OER policy that govern the integration of OER, establish the adopted licensing mechanisms in the integration of OER’s and
finally to explore the challenges faced by academic libraries in the integration of OER. An emphasis was placed on two public and two private academic libraries that is Kenyatta University library, Multimedia University, Catholic University of Eastern Africa and Africa Nazarene University. The four universities presented a representation of academic universities in Kenya and it formed a baseline for a an OER study in Kenya and three of the university have embraced Open Distance and ELearning (ODEL).The study’s respondent included the university librarians and the library staff. The study used a population of 89 respondents. The research used census method of determining the sample size and thereby took the 89 to be the sample size. Data was collected using questionnaires, Interviews and secondary sources. Data from the respondents was presented using table, graphs and charts. The researcher noted that most of the academic libraries in Kenya have only integrated the E-books and E-Journals as the only OER’s.
Two of the university libraries have partnered with external OER providers and have integrated external OER’s. True to the statement of the problem most of the Educational materials are locked into the ODEL platforms and not to the libraries. Only one university has formulated an OER’s policy though it’s not functional, the others use openaccess collection development and others uses the ICT policies in the integration of OER. Most of the Universities use creative commons licenses in the sharing of the OER’s.
Some recommendations were made which includes; development of OER policies, having OER awareness campaigns, collaborating with national, regional and international organizations that provides OER and finally to solicit for funds for the sustainability of the OER initiatives. Further research was recommended on the role of faculty members in the integration of OER in the institution of higher learning.},
