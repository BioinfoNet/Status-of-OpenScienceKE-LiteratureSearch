Abstract

Relationships among seventy specimens, fifteen species and three genera of phlebotomines were inferred from the phylogenetic analysis of small subunit nuclear rDNA, obtained by the PCR amplification and cloning of almost full‐length genes. Outgroups included fifteen dipterans, and single representatives of four other insect orders. The more distant the taxa compared, the larger were the regions of ambiguous sequence alignment that needed to be deleted in order to avoid circularity in performing parsimony analyses. Phlebotomine sequences formed a monophyletic clade within the suborder Nematocera, with the progressively more basal sister groups of Diptera being Culicomorpha, Tipulomorpha and the suborder Brachycera. Within Phlebotominae, subgeneric relationships were resolved and the genus Phlebotomus was shown to be monophyletic, but markers for intraspecific geographical populations were not found and intergeneric relationships were not resolved.
Introduction

Phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) are often studied in relation to their role as the natural vectors of parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae). However, there have been few phylogenetic analyses of relationships among sandfly taxa or between sandflies and other insects. For many specialists the subfamily Phlebotominae comprises six genera: Phlebotomus , Sergentomyia and Chinius in the Old World (OW) and Lutzomyia , Brumptomyia and Warileya in the New World (NW) ( Lewis et al ., 1977 ), and all the Leishmania vectors are usually placed in Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia ( Killick‐Kendrick, 1990 ) (Authorities for all higher taxa and OW species are given by Seccombe et al . (1993) ). However, a recent phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters led to the conclusion that the OW species should be classified in seven genera ( Chinius , Phlebotomus , Australophlebotomus , Idiophlebotomus , Spelaeophlebotomus , Sergentomyia and Spelaeomyia ), although the monophyly of Sergentomyia was questioned ( Rispail & Léger, 1998a,b ).

Concerning higher taxonomic levels, the family Psychodidae is classified in the rather heterogeneous infraorder Psychodomorpha within the suborder Nematocera, the other dipteran suborder being Brachycera ( Hennig, 1981 ; Wood & Borkent, 1989 ). The Diptera and other orders of holometabolous insects are easily distinguished morphologically, but phylogenetic relationships among them have not been fully resolved ( Kristensen, 1991 ; Oosterbroek & Courtney, 1995 ).

Comparative analyses of nuclear ribosomal (r) RNA genes have been used to infer phylogenetic histories across a broad spectrum of taxa, from the basal lineages of life to relationships among closely related species and populations ( Hillis et al ., 1996 ). The small subunit (SSU) nuclear gene (16–18S rRNA) has been most studied, partly because it contains some of the slowest evolving sequences in living organisms and therefore has proven useful for examining ancient evolutionary events ( Hillis & Dixon, 1991 ). In addition, the slow rate of change of some of these sequences permits the design of universal primers which, along with the gene’s high copy number, facilitate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of SSU rDNA fragments from groups of organisms not previously investigated ( Hillis et al ., 1996 ). Several phylogenetic studies of the Holometabola have been based on SSU rDNA ( Carmean et al ., 1992 ; Miller et al ., 1997 ; Whiting et al ., 1997 ; Carreno & Barta, 1998 ).

Although there are often several hundred copies of SSU rDNA per haploid genome in Diptera, the pool of coding sequences is thought to remain homogeneous because of concerted evolution resulting from unequal crossing over or gene conversion ( Arnheim et al ., 1980 ; Dover, 1982 ; Arnheim, 1983 ; Coen & Dover, 1983 ). Some intraspecific sampling is still advisable ( Williams et al ., 1988 ) and, in this connection, it was reassuring that many restriction sites were diagnostic for phlebotomine species regardless of geographical origins ( Aransay et al ., 1999 ).

The present report on the SSU rDNA sequences of sandflies progresses beyond PCR‐RFLP diagnostics ( Aransay et al ., 1999 ) to analyse phylogenetic relationships. The specific aims were to determine whether or not there is concordance between the species’ relationships inferred from SSU rDNA and morphological characters, to discover whether full sequence information might provide markers for geographical populations, and to relate sandflies to other holometabolous insects. Our study concentrated on taxa found in Greece and Cyprus, and for this ten species of the genus Phlebotomus and three of Sergentomyia were analysed. The only sandfly SSU rDNA sequence reported until now was isolated from Lutzomyia ( Psathyromyia ) shannoni ( Dyar ) ( Miller et al ., 1997 ), and this was added to our SSU rDNA data set along with newly characterized sequences from Lutzomyia ( Lutzomyia ) longipalpis ( Lutz & Neiva ), the type species of Lutzomyia .
Results and discussion
Consensus sequences of specimens and species

PCR with primers F1 and R1 amplified a fragment of about 2000 base pairs (bp) from each of the seventy samples tested ( Table 1 ). All the PCR products were successfully cloned, and complete SSU rDNAs were amplified by PCR from single bacterial colonies before being sequenced on each strand ( Fig. 1 ). For each specimen, complete sequence assembly (from ‘contigs’) was unambiguous, and consensus sequences ranged from 2024 bp ( L. longipalpis ) to 2120 bp ( P. tobbi ) ( Table 1 ).

Positions of the variable regions in SSU rDNA alignments. In alignments 1 and 2 (a, b), black areas represent conserved regions where nucleotide sequences were unambiguously aligned between taxa, and other areas represent variable regions. Dashed lines relate the variable regions to those in the model for D. melanogaster ( Hancock et al ., 1988 ). Primers used for amplification (F1 and R1) and sequencing (F2, F3, R2 and R3) are located within the alignment.

Consensus sequences for each sandfly species were constructed manually and labelled P(Eu)arg ( P. argentipes ), P(La)tob ( P. tobbi ), P(La)perf ( P. perfiliewi ), P(La)pern ( P. perniciosus ), P(La)neg ( P. neglectus ), P(La)syr ( P. syriacus ), P(Ad)sim ( P. simici ), P(Pa)alex ( P. alexandri ), P(Pa)serg ( P. sergenti ), P(Ph)pap ( P. papatasi ), Smin ( S. minuta ), Sdent ( S. dentata ), Sfal ( S. fallax cypriotica ) and Llong ( L. longipalpis ).

Intraspecifically, there were only a few base differences, or none at all between some specimens of P. simici (SIM4, SIM5), P. neglectus (NEG1, NEG2), P. alexandri (ALEX3, ALEX7), P. sergenti (SERG1, SERG2, and SERG3, SERG4), P. papatasi (PAP1, PAP‐b) and S. minuta (MIN1, MIN2). PCR error could account for some of the intraspecific polymorphism, but other explanations include stochastic or selective amplification and cloning of different copies of the SSU rRNA gene (at different loci). However, concerted evolution is expected to homogenize the copies (see Introduction ). In order to test the homogeneity of the amplified SSU rRNA genes, PCR products of four samples ( Table 1 ) were directly sequenced. Unique sequences were obtained for each sample, identical to those obtained from the cloned PCR products.

When distant taxa were compared, large ambiguously aligned regions were found in positions occupied by ‘expansion segments’ in the secondary structure model of Drosophila melanogaster ( Hancock et al ., 1988 ). However, we are unaware of an algorithm that provides a single secondary structure for any expansion segment within higher taxa of insects. Certainly, based on the predictions of the MFOLD algorithm (GCG 1994), the secondary structure of the expansion segment V4 is variable among tiger beetles (family Cicindelidae) ( Vogler et al ., 1997 ) and Lutzomyia species (P. D. Ready and J. C. Day, unpublished observations). One solution to this problem is to use an algorithm such as MALIGN ( Wheeler & Gladstein, 1994 ) to optimize sequence alignments. However, we rejected this option for two reasons. Firstly, such algorithms attempt to optimize for the number of changes on a cladogram during sequence alignment and therefore later inferences from parsimony analysis can suffer from circular reasoning. Secondly, phylogenies inferred from expansion segments such as V4 have not been found to be consistent with those from other molecular data because, it was concluded, nonhomologous regions were being aligned ( Vogler et al ., 1997 ). For these reasons, we decided to exclude from our comparative sequence analyses regions that could not be unambiguously aligned.
Relationships with other holometabolous insects

The fifteen phlebotomine consensus sequences were aligned with those of fifteen non‐psychodid dipterans, one mecopteran, one siphonapteran, one trichopteran and one lepidopteran ( Fig. 1 ; alignment 1, EMBL accession number ds39837). Neither the beginning (nucleotides (nt) 1–40) nor the end (nt 2200–2220) of the SSU rDNA alignment was included in our analyses, because they were not available for all taxa.

A total of 826 bp from nine regions of ambiguously aligned sequences (labelled A to I) was excluded from the phylogenetic analysis ( Fig. 1 ). Using the codes of ‘expansion segments’ (V1–7) in the secondary‐structure model of Drosophila melanogaster 18S rRNA ( Hancock et al ., 1988 ), our region A (nt 130–137) corresponded to a single‐stranded part of V2, B (nt 179–334) to three stems in V2 (E9–1, E9–2, 10), C (nt 719–965), D (nt 1002–1028) and E (nt 1066–1115) to parts of V4, F (nt 1320–1342) and G (nt 1362–1377) to parts of V5, H (nt 1612–1784) to a part of V6, and I (nt 2095–2149) to a part of V7. Regions A–I were delimited by sequences homologous to conserved double‐stranded rRNA stems in D. melanogaster ( Hancock et al ., 1988 ). Excluding regions A–I, values of absolute genetic distances varied from 0.1% ( P. tobbi vs. P. perniciosus or P. argentipes; P. neglectus vs. P. argentipes ) to 21.1% ( Hydropsyche sp. (Trichoptera) vs. Eucorethra underwoodi (Diptera: Chaoboridae); Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera) vs. Dixella cornuta (Diptera: Dixidae)). The average transition/transversion ratio was 1.22 : 1. The lowest ratio (0.45 : 1) was between the culicid dipterans Aedes albopictus and Aedes punctor , and the highest (4 : 1) was also between culicids ( Culex tritaeniorrhynchus and Ae. punctor or Toxorhynchites amboinensis ). This is not consistent with a higher transition/transversion ratio for more closely related taxa, and the same is true for our other alignments. Out of 1394 characters analysed phylogenetically, 818 (58.6%) were constant, 252 (18.0%) were variable but parsimony‐uninformative, and 324 (23.4%) were variable and parsimony‐informative as defined by paup 4.0 ( Swofford, 1998 ). When two or more sequences were identical, only one was used in the parsimony analysis (the consensus sequences P(L)syr, P(L)perf and P(L)tob were identical, as were the consensus sequences P(Pa)alex, P(Pa)serg and P(P)pap). Maximum parsimony trees were sought using the branch‐and‐bound option of paup 4.0 ( Swofford, 1998 ). The analysis resulted in eighteen equally parsimonious trees when all characters had equal weighting and Hydropsyche sp. and Galleria mellonella were designated as the outgroup (tree length = 1084 steps; retention index (RI) = 0.81, rescaled consistency index (RC) = 0.52). After each of three rounds of reweighting characters by the maximum RC value, the same thirteen equally parsimonious trees were obtained (tree length = 570; RI = 0.92 and RC = 0.78), and the strict consensus is shown in Fig. 2 , along with bootstrap values for the branches shared with the 50% majority‐rule consensus tree. Most differences were in the relationships among the three sequences of Phlebotomus ( Larroussius ) – P(La)tob, P(La)pern and P(La)neg.

The strict consensus tree (maximum parsimony) for SSU rDNA sequences of holometabolous insects, based on branch‐and‐bound searches of alignment 1 (EMBL accession number ds39837). Bootstrap values (for those branches shared with 50% majority‐rule consensus tree) were calculated with the heuristic search option (100 replicates, each with ten searches using random addition and TBR branch swapping).

Archaeopsylla erinacei (Siphonaptera) and Boreus sp. (Mecoptera) formed the sister group to Diptera and this agrees with the phylogeny of Whiting et al . (1997) , who combined morphology with SSU and large subunit (LSU) rDNA sequence data. Monophyly of the dipterans was strongly supported (bootstrap: 100%), as there were fifty‐three diagnostic characters out of 103 apomorphies. Within Diptera, the suborder Brachycera (represented by two muscomorphans, D. melanogaster and Ornithoica vicina , and the tabanid Chrysops niger ) was the sister clade to the suborder Nematocera, in which the phlebotomines formed a monophyletic group (infraorder Psychodomorpha). The nematoceran clade included the cranefly Nephrotoma altissima (infraorder Tipulomorpha), as outgroup of Psychodomorpha and its sister infraorder Culicomorpha. This supports previous morphological studies ( Hennig, 1981 ; Wood & Borkent, 1989 ), unlike a molecular phylogeny based on LSU rDNA sequences that failed to resolve relationships among four strongly supported dipteran clades (Tipulomorpha, Bibionomorpha, Culicomorpha and Brachycera) or the position of Psychodidae, which was represented only by Psychoda cinerea ( Friedrich & Tautz, 1997 ).

All dipterans of the infraorder Culicomorpha formed one clade, characterized by sixty apomorphies, out of which eighteen characters were diagnostic (158, 161, 561, 584, 584, 613, 660, 697, 970, 1498, 1535, 1539, 1544, 1793, 1818, 1843, 1949, 2169). Relationships within the clade agreed with the parsimony consensus tree based on SSU and 5.8S rDNA reported by Miller et al . (1997) . As reported by these authors, the position of Dixella cornuta (Dixidae) in the molecular trees conflicts with comparative morphology, which places the family as a sister group to the Chaoboridae‐Culicidae clade in the superfamily Culicoidea ( Wood & Borkent, 1989 ).

The phlebotomine clade was well‐supported (bootstrap: 100%) and there were twelve diagnostic characters out of thirty‐one apomorphies (characters: 116, 124, 164, 351, 551, 606, 1161, 1185, 1817, 1896, 1933, 2076). The transition: transversion ratio within Phlebotominae ranged from 0 : 1 (P(La)tob vs. P(Eu)arg or P(La)pern) to 3 : 1 (P(La)pern vs. P(La)neg). The phylogenetic relationships among phlebotomine species were not robustly resolved: absolute genetic distances between their SSU rDNA sequences were low following the exclusion of regions that did not align well between insect families, e.g. the I‐region of V7 (nt 2095–2149) that contains many of the diagnostic apomorphies within Phlebotominae. Nevertheless, all species of the same genus usually clustered together, the exception being the grouping of L. shannoni with Phlebotomus species rather than with L. longipalpis (Llong). However, the branch containing Phlebotomus and L. shannoni was only supported by two non‐diagnostic apomorphies (characters 106 and 1196, with a consistency index (CI) of 0.25 and 0.50, respectively).
Phylogenetic relationships among phlebotomines

A first parsimony analysis was carried out with consensus sequences of each species and the major variants found in some specimens, namely: P(Eu)arg, P(La)tob, TOB2, TOB7, TOB8, P(La)perf, PERF5, P(La)pern, P(La)neg, P(La)syr, P(Ad)sim, P(Pa)alex, P(Pa)serg, P(Ph)pap, Smin, MIN3, Sdent, DENT1, Sfal, Llong and L. shannoni ( Fig. 1 ; alignment 2a, EMBL accession number ds39838). Four ambiguously aligned regions were omitted from the maximum parsimony analysis: B1 (nt 192–211), B2 (nt 246–272), C1 (nt 751–911) and H1 (nt 1630–1696) were within three of the eight variable regions that created alignment problems among families ( Fig. 1 ). The transition/transversion ratio varied from 0.67 : 1 (TOB8 vs. P(La)syr or P(La)tob) to 7 : 1 (MIN3 vs. Sfal).

Of the total of 1855 characters considered for a branch‐and‐bound search in paup 4.0, 1669 were constant, ninety‐two were variable but parsimony‐uninformative, and ninety‐four were variable and parsimony‐informative. The analysis gave twenty equally parsimonious trees (tree length = 235; RI = 0.91; RC = 0.77) when characters were unweighted and Lutzomyia sequences (Llong, L. shannoni ) were selected as outgroup. Outgroup selection was justified by the basal position of Llong in the previous analyses. After each of three rounds of reweighting characters by the maximum RC value, a branch‐and‐bound search gave the same twenty equally parsimonious trees (tree length = 186; RI = 0.97; RC = 0.91), and the strict consensus is shown in Fig. 3(A) together with the bootstrap support for the branches shared with the 50% majority‐rule consensus tree (with heuristic searches). This phylogeny is concordant with the results of Rispail & Léger (1998a , b ), based on morphological characters, except for the position of Euphlebotomus subgenus, which appears to be the basal clade to all samples of Larroussius and Adlerius subgenera; and it gives strong bootstrap support for the monophyletic clades that include all Phlebotomus species and all Sergentomyia species.

The strict consensus tree (maximum parsimony) for SSU rDNA sequences of phlebotomines, based on branch‐and‐bound searches of alignment 2a. Bootstrap values (for those branches shared with the 50% majority‐rule consensus tree) were calculated with the heuristic search option (1000 replicates, each with 100 searches using random addition and TBR branch swapping). (A) All consensus sequences and major variants for each species (B) only consensus sequences for each species.

The same procedure was followed to analyse only the species consensus sequences, i.e. excluding the major intraspecific variants that might not be orthologous ( Fig. 1 ; alignment 2b, EMBL accession number ds39839). Four ambiguously aligned sequence regions were omitted from the analysis. Regions B1 (nt 193–203), B2 (nt 245–274), C1 (nt 776–911) and H1 (nt 1639–1696) differed little from those excluded in the previous analysis, except that they were usually shorter. The transition/transversion ratio varied from 0.50 : 1 (Sdent vs. Sfal) to 5 : 1 (P(Pa)alex vs. P(Pa)serg). A total of 1901 characters was used for a branch‐and‐bound search in paup 4.0. Of these characters, 1626 were constant, 158 were variable but parsimony‐uninformative and 117 both variable and parsimony‐informative. When characters were unweighted and Lutzomyia sequences (Llong, L. shannoni ) were selected as outgroup, the analysis gave four equally parsimonious trees (tree length = 237; RI = 0.86; RC = 0.68). After each of three rounds of reweighting characters by the maximum RC value, a branch‐and‐bound search retained a single most parsimonious tree ( Fig. 3B : tree length = 163; RI = 0.96; RC = 0.90). Using an heuristic search and 1000 replicates, bootstrap analysis produced a 50% majority‐rule consensus tree (bootstrap percentages plotted on branches in Fig. 3B ) that was concordant with the results of Rispail & Léger (1998a,b) based on morphological characters, except for the position of Euphlebotomus subgenus that is, as in the previous analysis, the basal clade to all samples of Larroussius and Adlerius subgenera. The relationships among Phlebotomus species in the subgenera Larroussius and Adlerius were not resolved, except for the clade that united P(La)neg and P(La)syr. Within each subgenus, the pair‐wise sequence divergence was 0.1–5%.

Further analyses were then carried out to resolve the relationships among species and their geographical populations within each of the three clades of OW phlebotomines identified above, namely: (A) the clade containing the subgenera Euphlebotomus , Adlerius and Larroussius (EMBL accession number ds39841); (B) the clade comprising the subgenera Paraphlebotomus and Phlebotomus (EMBL accession number ds38648); and (C) the clade of species in the genus Sergentomyia, with Lutzomyia sequences as outgroup (EMBL accession number ds39840). The results of the branch‐and‐bound searches for the most parsimonious trees are given in Table 2 and Fig. 4 . There were no ambiguously aligned regions of SSU rDNA sequence when comparing taxa from closely related subgenera (sets A or B), in contrast to comparisons of Sergentomyia and Lutzomyia sequences (set C).

The strict consensus tree (maximum parsimony) for SSU rDNA sequences of phlebotomines, based on branch‐and‐bound searches of alignments: (A) Larroussius , Adlerius and Euphlebotomus (EMBL accession number ds39841); (B) Phlebotomus and Paraphlebotomus (EMBL accession number ds 38648) and (C) Sergentomyia and Lutzomyia taxa (EMBL accession number ds 39840). Bootstrap values (for those branches shared with the 50% majority‐rule) on branches were calculated with the heuristic search option (100 replicates, each with ten searches using random addition and TBR branch swapping).

The strict consensus of the 198 equally parsimonious trees obtained by a branch‐and‐bound search of the alignment of Euphlebotomus , Adlerius and Larroussius sequences is concordant with species classifications based on morphology ( Fig. 4A ). Branches defining each subgenus were well supported: the Euphlebotomus clade (ARG1, ARG2), chosen as the outgroup based on previous analyses, was supported by forty‐seven apomorphic characters, out of which thirty‐seven were diagnostic (bootstrap support ingroup: 100%); the Adlerius clade (SIM 1–5) was supported by fourteen diagnostic characters out of twenty‐two apomorphies (bootstrap: 100%); and the Larroussius clade (the rest) was supported by eleven apomorphies (eight diagnostic characters: 197, 378, 739, 753, 760, 844, 1614, 1616; bootstrap: 90%). However, internal branches within Larroussius were not well supported, except for the clade that united the former subspecies P. neglectus and P. syriacus of the Phlebotomus major group ( Léger & Pesson, 1987 ), characterized by four diagnostic characters (734, 749, 834, 1633) out of six apomorphies (bootstrap: 95%). Interspecific absolute genetic distances varied from 0.43% (NEG4 with SYR2) to 4.24% (ARG2 with TOB8), and intraspecific distances varied from 0.05% (ARG1 with ARG2) to 1.53% (TOB2 with TOB8). Phlebotomus neglectus and its sibling P. syriacus formed the basal clade of Larroussius , in which P. perniciosus and P. tobbi appeared as sister species. This conforms with the findings of Esseghir et al . (1997 , 2000 ) based on mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and nuclear (elongation factor alpha) DNA.

The other two parsimony analyses also grouped sequences (bootstrap ranged from 98 to 100%) according to the subgeneric or species classification based on morphological similarities except for S. dentata ( Fig. 4B,C ). There was no obvious geographical grouping of the SSU rDNA sequences for any of the species, which suggests either a very low rate of sequence divergence or an absence of geographical isolation of populations. Looking in detail at the three alignments of the sequences, we found that the most similar sequences do not have the same origin. For example, in the alignment ds39841, samples collected within the same area show many differences (e.g. SIM1 compared with SIM2; NEG4 compared with NEG6 or NEG7), and samples from different populations show very similar sequences (e.g. SIM1 compared with SIM3, SIM4 or SIM5; NEG1 compared with NEG2, NEG3, NEG5 or NEG8).
General conclusions

The SSU rRNA gene has been shown to be useful for diagnostic PCR‐RFLP of sandflies ( Aransay et al ., 1999 ), and we now confirm that it is also useful for inferring phylogenetic relationships within the subfamily Phlebotominae. We show for the first time that analyses of SSU rDNA sequences can be used to infer the relationships among sandflies at subgenus and species levels, although there are problems deriving unambiguous sequence alignments.

The more distant the taxa compared, the larger were the regions of ambiguous sequence alignment. The highly variable regions were located in positions occupied by ‘expansion segments’ in the secondary structure model of D. melanogaster ( Hancock et al ., 1988 ). For the present study, we decided to exclude regions that could not be unambiguously aligned and, unsurprisingly, the number and length of these increased with genetic distance. Consequently, separate phylogenetic analyses had to be undertaken for each alignment, and this reduced the number of characters available for analysing relationships among phlebotomine genera. Generic relationships were not resolved, but this problem is probably better addressed when more subgenera have been sampled.

Based on our alignment of sequences from different insect orders, Tipulidae was shown to form the basal branch in Nematocera, as selected by Miller et al . (1997) on the basis of morphological studies ( Hennig, 1973 ; Wood & Borkent, 1989 ). However, our result disagrees with the relationships among dipteran sub‐ and infra‐orders inferred by Carreno & Barta (1998) in their analysis of SSU rDNAs. This discrepancy could be due to differences in alignments (including the number of characters used) or to the selection and number of the compared samples.

The five Phlebotomus subgenera studied ( Phlebotomus , Paraphlebotomus , Euphlebotomus , Adlerius and Larroussius ) were clustered in a monophyletic group supported by several synapomorphies (thirteen diagnostic characters out of seventeen apomorphies, 100% bootstrap value), and this contrasted with the paraphyly of the genus Phlebotomus inferred from the analysis of the D2 domain of LSU rDNA of a smaller number of sandfly species ( Depaquit et al ., 1998 ). The position of the subgenus Euphlebotomus , as basal to Larroussius and Adlerius subgenera, contradicts the results of Rispail & Léger (1998a , b ) based on morphological characters. Interestingly, these three subgenera contain most of the OW vectors of the Leishmania donovani complex.
Experimental procedures
Specimens

Phlebotomine characterized in this study were from field collections or were obtained from established colonies ( Table 1 ). Specimens were stored in liquid nitrogen, 70% ethanol or dried over silica‐gel, until they were processed. Sandflies were dissected in order to make slide mounts of heads and last abdominal segments for morphological identification, based on the keys described by Adler (1946) and Leger et al . (1986) .
PCR and sequencing

Genomic DNA from individual sandflies was extracted by a potassium acetate protein precipitation method as described by Aransay et al . (1999) . The SSU rRNA genes were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ( Aransay et al ., 1999 ) using degenerate primers complementary to conserved sequences at the 5′ end of the gene (forward (F1), 5′‐GCGGTTGATYCTRC CAGT‐3′) and the 3′ end (reverse (R1), 5′‐CYGCAGGTTCAC CTACRG‐3′) (F1: from bp 4–21 and R1: from 1984 to 1966 of Drosophila melanogaster 18S rDNA sequence; Tautz et al ., 1988 ).

One‐fifth of the PCR products was resolved in 1.2% agarose gels and visualized under UV transillumination. The remaining PCR reaction was column‐purified (GFXTM PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kit, Pharmacia‐Biotech). About 100 ng of each amplified product were ligated into either pGEM‐T Easy vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or pMOSblue T‐vector (Amersham Life Science Ltd, UK). XL‐2 competent cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmids. Recombinant bacterial colonies were the target for reamplifying the SSU rRNA genes with primers −47 (5′‐CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC‐3′) and RP‐OPTI (Reverse primer, 5′‐GGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACA‐3′), which are in the poly linker of both plasmids used, and products were purified by precipitation with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) buffer (15% PEG‐8000, 1  m NaCl and 15 m m EDTA pH 8.0).

Sequencing of 200 ng of each PCR product was carried out by cycle sequencing (Sequitherm Excell II Long‐Read DNA Seq. Kit) using M13‐Universal and M13‐Reverse primers as well as internal primers F2 (5′‐GGCGCGTAAATTACCCAATC‐3′), F3 (5′‐GCTTCTTAAATGGACAAAAT‐3′), R2 (5′‐ACCTGTTATT GCTCAATCTC‐3′) and R3 (5′‐CTCGGATGTGAGTCCTGTAT‐3′) ( Fig. 1 ). Sequences were resolved in a LI‐COR 4200 automated sequencer.

Sequence analyses

Partial sequences were aligned in DNAMAN for windows, version 2.6 ( Woffelman, 1994–96 ), so that sequences of complete genes were determined on both strands. Sequences were assembled by SeqPUP ( Gilbert, 1995 ). Multiple sequence alignments were achieved using CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence Alignment Program, version 1.7 ( Higgins et al ., 1997 ), applying default settings (Gap opening penalty: 10.00; Gap extension penalty: 0.05; delay divergent sequences: 40%; and DNA transitions weight: 0.50). The resulting alignments were compared and divergent (or ambiguously aligned) regions were excluded, based on the secondary‐structure model described for Drosophila melanogaster 18S rRNA ( Hancock et al ., 1988 ). Maximum parsimony analyses were accomplished using the branch‐and‐bound option or, for bootstrap analyses, the heuristic search option in paup 4.0 ( Swofford, 1998 ). Absolute genetic distance and transition: transversion ratio values were determined using subroutines of paup 4.0 ( Swofford, 1998 ).
