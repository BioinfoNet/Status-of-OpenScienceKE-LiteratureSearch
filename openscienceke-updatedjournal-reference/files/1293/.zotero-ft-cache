Abstract

We use forty years of animal and plant data collected in the Amboseli and Magadi ecosystems in Kajiado county, southern Kenya to demonstrate the application of open source tools to spatial analysis and the visualization of results. These highly interactive tools developed in R contain a series of commands that perform various data functions including: examining the data structure, aggregation, exploratory data analysis, vegetation biomass, greenness and grazing pressure estimations, NDVI extraction, species population estimation and spatial mapping, among other tasks. We customized the tools to suit the local community information needs and level of expertise without losing the underlying data richness or integrity. The implementation requires basic computer knowledge and can be undertaken by local community trainees using straight forward commands.

The results show that with these automated tools, long-term data in large databases can be analyzed rapidly and presented in a way that encourages community participation, ownership and uptake locally and regionally. The tools allow biodiversity scenario building and other functions such as the identification of migratory corridors, habitat utilization by animal species and general land use and resource management.
