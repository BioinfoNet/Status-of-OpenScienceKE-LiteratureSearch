Title 	Access and Accountability - A Study of Open Data in Kenya
Author 	Silveira Wennergren, Tove
Date 	2014
English abstract
This study explores Open Data actors in Kenya, focusing on the issue of transparency and accountability. Drawing on an exploratory quantitative analysis of existing statistical material of usage of the Kenya Open Data Initiative website and 15 qualitative interviews conducted primarily in Nairobi, the study analyses key factors – both enabling and disabling – that shape transparency initiatives connected to Open Data in Kenya. The material is analysed from three perspectives: a) a review based on existing research around impact and effectiveness of transparency and accountability initiatives; b) based on theories on human behaviour in connection to transparency and accountability; and c) introducing a critical perspective on power relations based on Michel Foucault’s concept of ‘governmentality’. The study shows that the Kenya Open Data Initiative has potential to become an effective transparency and accountability initiative in Kenya, but that its future is heavily dependent on current trends within the political context and fluctuations in power relations. Applying a stronger user-perspective and participatory approach is critical. Open Data is a relatively new area within the governance and development field, and academia can play an important role in enhancing methodology and impact assessments to create more effective and sustainable initiatives and ensure that future Open Data initiatives can be both accessible and constitute a base for accountability.
