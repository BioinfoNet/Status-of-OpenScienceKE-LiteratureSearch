It is written in R and is integrated with two other existing R packages (ape and adegenet). pegas provides functions for standard population genetic methods, as well as low-level functions for developing new methods. The flexible and efficient graphical capabilities of R are used for plotting haplotype networks as well as for other functionalities. pegas emphasizes the need to further develop an integrated-modular approach for software dedicated to the analysis of population genetic data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":3628259,"mean":4.9430875566221,"rank":2904081,"pct":2,"higher_than":75640},"journal":{"count":3705,"mean":5.1321641468682,"rank":3303,"pct":2,"higher_than":77},"similar_age_3m":{"count":55734,"mean":4.5996895196741,"rank":38498,"pct":1,"higher_than":312},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":94,"mean":3.9356989247312,"rank":73,"pct":1,"higher_than":1}},"authors":["E.
