Abstract

spads 1.0 (for ‘Spatial and Population Analysis of DNA Sequences’) is a population genetic toolbox for characterizing genetic variability within and among populations from DNA sequences. In view of the drastic increase in genetic information available through sequencing methods, spads was specifically designed to deal with multilocus data sets of DNA sequences. It computes several summary statistics from populations or groups of populations, performs input file conversions for other population genetic programs and implements locus‐by‐locus and multilocus versions of two clustering algorithms to study the genetic structure of populations. The toolbox also includes two Matlab and r functions, Gdispal and Gdivpal , to display differentiation and diversity patterns across landscapes. These functions aim to generate interpolating surfaces based on multilocus distance and diversity indices. In the case of multiple loci, such surfaces can represent a useful alternative to multiple pie charts maps traditionally used in phylogeography to represent the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. These coloured surfaces can also be used to compare different data sets or different diversity and/or distance measures estimated on the same data set.
Introduction

Initially, population genetics and phylogeographic studies using DNA sequence markers were based on single‐locus data sets. Today, however, most intraspecific DNA sequence data sets include multiple loci. Such data sets are not only used to characterize and compare patterns of genetic diversity and population structure within or between species, but also to study their past history using, for example, methods based on coalescence models (Rosenberg & Nordborg 2002 ; Marjoram & Tavaré 2006 ). Here, we present spads 1.0, a toolbox to characterize genetic diversity and population structure from multilocus DNA sequences. spads computes several summary statistics to summarize population diversity and structure (e.g. G ST , N ST , IBDSC , X H , π , π R , A R , AMOVA Φ ‐statistics), including standard statistics available in other population genetic programs, but also new statistics. Multilocus versions of two classic clustering methods defining groups of populations a posteriori and based on pairwise genetic distances (SAMOVA and Monmonier algorithm) are implemented. It can also create ad hoc input files for other popular clustering methods that are based solely on allelic frequencies (i.e. as opposed to using information on genetic distance between pairs of alleles; Pritchard et al . 2000 ; Corander et al . 2003 , 2004 , 2008 ; Guillot et al . 2005a , b , 2008 ). Finally, the toolbox spads includes Matlab and r functions implementing an extension of a method developed by Miller ( 2005 ) to represent patterns of interindividual distances across landscapes. Our extension adds the possibility to also represent patterns of genetic diversity across landscapes and the ability to use any measure of genetic distance or diversity.

Although many methods implemented in spads were already available in separate programs (mostly arlequin for summary statistics computation; Excoffier et al . 2005 ; Excoffier & Lischer 2010 ), we here propose a friendly user toolbox specifically designed to deal with multilocus data sets and which can be used as a starting point for exploring a DNA sequence data set, from which the user can easily switch to other programs for complementary analyses using the input file conversion option.
Summary statistics

spads computes a number of summary statistics separately for each locus: the total number of haplotypes (total number of different sequences detected for each locus), estimators of population differentiation G ST (Pons & Petit 1995 ) and N ST (Pons & Petit 1996 ), the AMOVA Φ ST estimator when considering only one group of populations (Excoffier et al . 1992 ), the isolation by distance slope coefficient IBDSC defined as the slope coefficient of the linear regression estimated from ( Φ ST /(1‐ Φ ST )) = f(ln( x )) (Rousset 1997 ), and mΦ ST dgeo, the average ratio between Φ ST and geographical distance over all pairs of populations (a similar statistic was already computed by Mulcahy et al . 2006 ). As mΦ ST dgeo will highlight geographically close populations that are genetically distant, this statistic can be used to detect departure from a pattern of isolation by distance. Statistical tests for the three F ‐statistics ( G ST , N ST and Φ ST ) are based on random permutations of individuals between populations, while the statistical test for the difference between N ST and G ST (highlighting the extent of the phylogeographic signal) is based on random permutations of haplotypes (Hardy & Vekemans 2002 ). Corresponding P ‐values are the proportions of permutated data sets with a F ‐statistic higher or equal to the one estimated from the real data. The software also estimates several statistics on groups of populations defined a priori by the user: the ratio X H between the number of haplotypes in each group and the total number of haplotypes , nucleotide diversity π (Nei & Li 1979 ), the ratio π R between nucleotide diversity within each group and nucleotide diversity within the virtual group formed by all other populations (Mardulyn et al . 2009 ), allelic richness A R (El Mousadik & Petit 1996 ) and AMOVA Φ ‐statistics (Excoffier et al . 1992 ). Statistical tests for the three AMOVA Φ ‐statistics ( Φ SC , Φ ST and Φ CT ) are based on random permutations, the kind of permutation implemented depending on the Φ ‐statistic tested (Excoffier et al . 1992 ). All these summary statistics are briefly described in Table S1 (Supporting information; see the toolbox manual for further details). To verify the accuracy of the computations provided by the program, standard statistics computed by spads were compared with values obtained with other available programs ( fstat , Goudet 1995 ; samova , Dupanloup et al . 2002 ; Spagedi , Hardy & Vekemans 2002 ; arlequin , Excoffier et al . 2005 ; Excoffier & Lischer 2010 ) .
Clustering analyses

spads implements two clustering methods based on pairwise distances among DNA sequences to define groups of populations a posteriori : a SAMOVA (i.e. spatial analysis of molecular variance, Dupanloup et al . 2002 ) and a Monmonier algorithm (Dupanloup et al . 2002 ; Manni et al . 2004 ). Compared with the original implementation of the SAMOVA (Dupanloup et al . 2002 ), users can specify the number of search iterations to perform for each run (independent repeats with different initial partitions of populations) of the algorithm. The second method is a Monmonier algorithm as implemented in the software barrier (Manni et al . 2004 ) but here based on a matrix of pairwise Φ ST among populations (Excoffier et al . 1992 ) directly computed on the DNA sequence data sets. spads includes multilocus versions of these two methods. For each assumption of the number of groups ( K ), the multilocus version of the SAMOVA algorithm analyzes all loci simultaneously, using a multilocus weighted average Φ CT (instead of the Φ CT calculated for one locus; Excoffier et al . 1992 ) to compare two successive iterations. Similarly to the multilocus version of the SAMOVA, the multilocus version of the Monmonier algorithm computes multilocus weighted average Φ ST estimators (instead of pairwise Φ ST for one locus; Excoffier et al . 1992 ) to position barriers between populations on the map. Note that, contrary to the automated version implemented in spads , the software barrier does not allow to start from DNA sequences, but, on the other hand, generates graphical outputs that are very helpful to interpret the results. When selecting this clustering method in spads , the program will automatically generate input files based on multilocus information that can be read by the software barrier of Manni et al . ( 2004 ) to produce these graphical outputs. For generating this input file and for the inference of barrier(s) with the Monmonier algorithm, users can provide their own matrix of pairwise distances among sampled populations. Otherwise, pairwise Φ ST computed from DNA sequences is used as default.
Input file conversions

spads can construct input files from DNA sequence alignments for several population genetic programs: Spagedi (Hardy & Vekemans 2002 ), structure (Pritchard et al . 2000 ), baps (Corander et al . 2003 , 2004 , 2008 ) and geneland (Guillot et al . 2005a , b , 2008 , 2012 ; Guedj & Guillot 2011 ). The interest of using spads to generate such input files is that, to the best of our knowledge, these other programs cannot directly analyse matrices of DNA sequences alignment. spads can also create input files for the Gdispal and Gdivpal Matlab or r functions (see below). structure , baps and geneland all implement clustering methods based solely on allelic frequencies (i.e. that do not take genetic distance among alleles into account). Recently, Cheng et al . ( 2013 ) extended the spatially explicit baps model for clustering DNA sequence data as well. For baps , spads creates two distinct baps input files: (i) one for the method based on allelic frequencies and (ii) a second for the method dealing with DNA sequences. Note that when choosing the clustering analysis based on the Monmonier algorithm, spads will also generate input files for the corresponding analysis implemented in the software barrier (Manni et al . 2004 ).
Mapping genetic diversity and differentiation: Gdispal and Gdivpal

In addition to the Java executable spads 1.0, we also included in this toolbox Matlab and r functions implementing an extension of a method initially developed by Miller ( 2005 , see also Miller et al . 2006 ) to display patterns of interindividual genetic distance across a species distribution. The method of Miller ( 2005 ) is based on a connectivity network (e.g. a Delaunay triangulation) built from the sampling localities. In this method, interindividual genetic distances are estimated and assigned to landscape coordinates at midpoints of each connectivity network edge. An interpolation procedure (i.e. an inverse distance‐weighted interpolation; Watson & Philips 1985 ; Watson 1992 ) is used to infer genetic distances at different locations uniformly spaced on a grid. Here, we propose an extension of this interpolation method in order to use any different measures of genetic distances and, furthermore, any different measures of genetic diversity. In the case of diversity measures, instead of basing the interpolation procedure on distance values assigned at midpoints of each edge of a connectivity network, it uses diversity values directly estimated at each sampling point, hereafter simply designated as a ‘population’. These interpolation methods are implemented in the two Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc) or r (R Development Core Team 2008 ) functions: Gdispal for ‘genetic distance patterns across landscapes’ and Gdivpal for ‘genetic diversity patterns across landscapes’. In these two functions, the inverse distance interpolation parameter a can be set to different values. We advise users to explore the influence of this parameter on the shape and smoothness of the interpolations. In Gdispal , interpolations are all based on a Delaunay triangulation network. Surfaces created with these two functions can be seen in three dimensions or as heat maps to facilitate the comparison between several data sets. In this case, the colour scale can be standardized to allow direct visual comparison between several heat maps based on the same distance or diversity measure.

spads can use different distance measures to create Gdispal function input files: (i) IID 1 (for ‘interindividual distance 1’), an interindividual distance based on allelic frequencies as defined by Miller ( 2005 ) and (ii) IID 2 (for ‘interindividual distance 2’), an interindividual distance based on pairwise nucleotide differences between DNA sequences (p‐distance averaged across loci). Further details on these interindividual distances, including related formulas, are available in the manual. When there is a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distances, Manni et al . ( 2004 ) recommend using residual genetic distances derived from the linear regression of genetic against geographical distances. Another way to deal with a correlation between genetic and geographical distances is to use ‘pseudoslopes’ that Miller ( 2005 ) defined as the quotient of congruent elements from the genetic and geographical distance matrices. spads can then also create regression residual and pseudoslope distance matrices computed from IID 1 and IID 2 measures.

Similarly, spads uses different diversity measures to create input files for the Gdivpal function: (i) the allelic richness A R (El Mousadik & Petit 1996 ) estimated within each population, (ii) the nucleotide diversity π (Nei & Li 1979 ) of each population and (iii) the relative nucleotide diversity π R (Mardulyn et al . 2009 ) of each population.
A practical example of using the Gdispal and Gdivpal functions

Colletes hederae is a solitary bee currently studied for its recent range expansion in Western Europe, possibly a result of current global warming (Dellicour et al . in press). In this context, it is interesting to analyse the distribution of genetic diversity across the species range, especially for comparing old and newly colonized areas. One hundred haploid males sampled across the western portion of its range (i.e. France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland) were sequenced at three nuclear loci. Figure  1 presents the results of analysing interindividual distances and population diversity with the Matlab functions Gdispal and Gdivpal . Note that, as advised by Manni et al . ( 2004 ), interindividual distances were computed using residual distances derived from the linear regression of genetic vs. geographical distances. The analysis of this data set is described in detail in a tutorial available in the software manual focusing on (i) the use of spads for computing several statistics and converting input files and (ii) the use of the r versions of the Gdispal and Gdivpal functions. The four interpolating surfaces shown in Fig.  1 can be used to highlight areas with higher population differentiation (i.e. red areas in IID 1 and IID 2 surfaces) and areas with higher genetic diversity (i.e. red areas in A R and π surfaces). Also, this example illustrates that indices taking the genetic distance between DNA sequences into account (i.e. IID 2 and π ) can display notably different patterns than those based on indices only based on allelic frequencies (i.e. IID 1 and A R ). These interpolating surfaces can be used to explore data, help to visualize complex multilocus information and also to visually compare spatial patterns of genetic variability among different species analysed with the same DNA sequence markers.

Using spads

Running spads requires three types of input files: (i) the DNA sequence matrices in sequential Phylip format (Felsenstein 2004 ), (ii) a ‘populations’ file containing the geographical coordinates of each population and (iii) a ‘groups’ file defining the different groups of populations to analyse. A double click on the program file will prompt the program interface. The user is asked to complete different fields (e.g. number of loci, number of user‐defined groups), to choose the input files directory and to specify the input files name before launching the analysis. As output, spads creates at least a ‘results’ and a ‘messages’ file, the second containing possible errors as well as additional information regarding the analyses performed (e.g. populations Φ ST matrices used by the locus‐by‐locus Monmonier algorithm). In addition, spads will also generate input files for Spagedi , structure , baps , geneland and/or Gdispal ‐ Gdivpal functions, when required by the user.
