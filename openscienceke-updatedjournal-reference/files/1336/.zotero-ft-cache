Abstract

Open Source Software is the major rival in the software market previously dominated by proprietary software products. Open Source Software(OSS) is available in various forms including web servers, Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERPs), Academic management systems and network management systems and the development and uptake of such software by both commercial and non-commercial companies and institutions is still on the rise. The availability of OSS applications for every common type of enterprise, minimal licensing issues and availability of source code as well as ease of access has made the technology even more attractive in learning and teaching of software based courses in institutions of learning. Through embracing this technology, institutions of learning have been able to minimize general operations cost that could have otherwise been incurred in procuring similar proprietary software. Students and teaching staff can nowadays interact and modify the readily available source code hence making learning and teaching more practical.

Keywords: Information and Communication Technology(ICT), Apache Internet Information Server (IIS), MYSQL, Open Source Software (OSS), Open Source Technology, Return on Investment (ROI)
