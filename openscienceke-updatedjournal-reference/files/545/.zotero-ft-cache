Challenges of Access to Literature and Attitude among Postgraduate Students in Open and Distance Learning: A Case of Egerton University Kenya
O Ngumi

Abstract

University education involves exposure to wide reading and research among students. This is more critical to postgraduate students, who are required to read much more on their own and prepare for their research and thesis undertakings. Looking at universities in the third world countries, there are challenges of access to current and relevant literature. This is due to lack of modern library facilities as well as high costs of accessing the available ones. The uptake of modern technology in learning and teaching including e-learning and Open Educational Resources are still out of reach by many learners and lecturers alike. Distance learners are also faced with time constraints as they work, and many of them are very far from any access to literature. This study aimed at determining the level of access to literature and related challenges including attitude, among postgraduate students who are in the open and distance learning (ODL) mode at Egerton University. The study revealed the gaps existing in access to literature and their effects on the quality of learning and research outputs of these learners. Further the findings revealed the attitudinal issues that have compounded this problem as learners and academicians transit from traditional sources of literature to the use of modern technology.

Key Words: access to literature, attitude, open and distance learning, postgraduate students, modern technology, internet, open educational resources.
