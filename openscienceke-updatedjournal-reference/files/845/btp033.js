Core features include keyboard and mouse-based editing, multiple views and alignment overviews, and linked structure display with Jmol. Jalview 2 is available in two forms: a lightweight Java applet for use in web applications, and a powerful desktop application that employs web services for sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction and the retrieval of alignments, sequences, annotation and structures from public databases and any DAS 1.53 compliant sequence or annotation server.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":13133585,"mean":7.967780171799,"rank":402369,"pct":96,"higher_than":12731556},"journal":{"count":8648,"mean":6.9670479935238,"rank":137,"pct":98,"higher_than":8511},"similar_age_3m":{"count":275322,"mean":8.1106155142542,"rank":9820,"pct":96,"higher_than":265502},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":187,"mean":7.5105268817204,"rank":6,"pct":96,"higher_than":181}},"authors":["A.
