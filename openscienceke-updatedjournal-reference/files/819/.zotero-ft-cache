Introduction

This chapter serves as a reference for all supported parameters for the E-utilities, along with accepted values and usage guidelines. This information is provided for each E-utility in sections below, and parameters and/or values specific to particular databases are discussed within each section. Most E-utilities have a set of parameters that are required for any call, in addition to several additional optional parameters that extend the tool's functionality. These two sets of parameters are discussed separately in each section.
Go to:
General Usage Guidelines

Please see Chapter 2 for a detailed discussion of E-utility usage policy. The following two parameters should be included in all E-utility requests.
tool

Name of application making the E-utility call. Value must be a string with no internal spaces.
email

E-mail address of the E-utility user. Value must be a string with no internal spaces, and should be a valid e-mail address.
api_key – enforced in December 2018

In December 2018, NCBI will begin enforcing the practice of using an API key for sites that post more than 3 requests per second. Please see Chapter 2 for a full discussion of this new policy.
Go to:
E-utilities DTDs

With the exception of EFetch, the E-utilities each generate a single XML output format that conforms to a DTD specific for that utility. Links to these DTDs are provided in the XML headers of the E-utility returns.

ESummary version 2.0 produces unique XML DocSums for each Entrez database, and as such each Entrez database has a unique DTD for version 2.0 DocSums. Links to these DTDs are provided in the version 2.0 XML.

EFetch produces output in a variety of formats, some of which are XML. Most of these XML formats also conform to DTDs or schema specific to the relevant Entrez database. Please follow the appropriate link below for the PubMed DTD:

    PubMed DTD June 2018 – current PubMed DTD
    PubMed DTD January 2019 – forthcoming DTD

Go to:
EInfo
Base URL

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/einfo.fcgi
Functions

    Provides a list of the names of all valid Entrez databases
    Provides statistics for a single database, including lists of indexing fields and available link names

Required Parameters

None. If no db parameter is provided, einfo will return a list of the names of all valid Entrez databases.
Optional Parameters
db

Target database about which to gather statistics. Value must be a valid Entrez database name .
version

Used to specify version 2.0 EInfo XML. The only supported value is ‘2.0’. When present, EInfo will return XML that includes two new fields: <IsTruncatable> and <IsRangeable>. Fields that are truncatable allow the wildcard character ‘*’ in terms. The wildcard character will expand to match any set of characters up to a limit of 600 unique expansions. Fields that are rangeable allow the range operator ‘:’ to be placed between a lower and upper limit for the desired range (e.g. 2008:2010[pdat]).
retmode

Retrieval type. Determines the format of the returned output. The default value is ‘xml’ for EInfo XML, but ‘json’ is also supported to return output in JSON format.
Examples

Return a list of all Entrez database names:

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/einfo.fcgi

Return version 2.0 statistics for Entrez Protein:

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/einfo.fcgi?db=protein&version=2.0
Go to:
ESearch
Base URL

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi
Functions

    Provides a list of UIDs matching a text query
    Posts the results of a search on the History server
    Downloads all UIDs from a dataset stored on the History server
    Combines or limits UID datasets stored on the History server
    Sorts sets of UIDs

Required Parameters
db

Database to search. Value must be a valid Entrez database name (default = pubmed).
term

Entrez text query. All special characters must be URL encoded. Spaces may be replaced by '+' signs. For very long queries (more than several hundred characters long), consider using an HTTP POST call. See the PubMed or Entrez help for information about search field descriptions and tags. Search fields and tags are database specific.

 esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=asthma

Optional Parameters – History Server
usehistory

When usehistory is set to 'y', ESearch will post the UIDs resulting from the search operation onto the History server so that they can be used directly in a subsequent E-utility call. Also, usehistory must be set to 'y' for ESearch to interpret query key values included in term or to accept a WebEnv as input.
WebEnv

Web environment string returned from a previous ESearch, EPost or ELink call. When provided, ESearch will post the results of the search operation to this pre-existing WebEnv, thereby appending the results to the existing environment. In addition, providing WebEnv allows query keys to be used in term so that previous search sets can be combined or limited. As described above, if WebEnv is used, usehistory must be set to 'y'.

 esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=asthma&WebEnv=<webenv string>&usehistory=y

query_key

Integer query key returned by a previous ESearch, EPost or ELink call. When provided, ESearch will find the intersection of the set specified by query_key and the set retrieved by the query in term (i.e. joins the two with AND). For query_key to function, WebEnv must be assigned an existing WebEnv string and usehistory must be set to 'y'.

Values for query keys may also be provided in term if they are preceeded by a '#' (%23 in the URL). While only one query_key parameter can be provided to ESearch, any number of query keys can be combined in term . Also, if query keys are provided in term , they can be combined with OR or NOT in addition to AND.

 The following two URLs are functionally equivalent:
 
 esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=asthma&query_key=1&WebEnv=
 <webenv string>&usehistory=y
 
 esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=%231+AND+asthma&WebEnv=
 <webenv string>&usehistory=y

Optional Parameters – Retrieval
retstart

Sequential index of the first UID in the retrieved set to be shown in the XML output (default=0, corresponding to the first record of the entire set). This parameter can be used in conjunction with retmax to download an arbitrary subset of UIDs retrieved from a search.
retmax

Total number of UIDs from the retrieved set to be shown in the XML output (default=20). By default, ESearch only includes the first 20 UIDs retrieved in the XML output. If usehistory is set to 'y', the remainder of the retrieved set will be stored on the History server; otherwise these UIDs are lost. Increasing retmax allows more of the retrieved UIDs to be included in the XML output, up to a maximum of 100,000 records. To retrieve more than 100,000 UIDs, submit multiple esearch requests while incrementing the value of retstart (see Application 3).
rettype

Retrieval type. There are two allowed values for ESearch: 'uilist' (default), which displays the standard XML output, and 'count', which displays only the <Count> tag.
retmode

Retrieval type. Determines the format of the returned output. The default value is ‘xml’ for ESearch XML, but ‘json’ is also supported to return output in JSON format.
sort

Specifies the method used to sort UIDs in the ESearch output. The available values vary by database ( db ) and may be found in the Display Settings menu on an Entrez search results page. If usehistory is set to ‘y’, the UIDs are loaded onto the History Server in the specified sort order and will be retrieved in that order by ESummary or EFetch. Example values are ‘relevance’ and ‘name’ for Gene and ‘first+author’ and ‘pub+date’ for PubMed. Users should be aware that the default value of sort varies from one database to another, and that the default value used by ESearch for a given database may differ from that used on NCBI web search pages.
field

Search field. If used, the entire search term will be limited to the specified Entrez field. The following two URLs are equivalent:

 esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=asthma&field=title
 
 esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=asthma[title]

idtype

Specifies the type of identifier to return for sequence databases (nuccore, nucest, nucgss, popset, protein). By default, ESearch returns GI numbers in its output. If idtype is set to ‘acc’, ESearch will return accession.version identifiers rather than GI numbers.
Optional Parameters – Dates
datetype

Type of date used to limit a search. The allowed values vary between Entrez databases, but common values are 'mdat' (modification date), 'pdat' (publication date) and 'edat' (Entrez date). Generally an Entrez database will have only two allowed values for datetype .
reldate

When reldate is set to an integer n , the search returns only those items that have a date specified by datetype within the last n days.
mindate, maxdate

Date range used to limit a search result by the date specified by datetype . These two parameters ( mindate, maxdate ) must be used together to specify an arbitrary date range. The general date format is YYYY/MM/DD, and these variants are also allowed: YYYY, YYYY/MM.
Examples

Search in PubMed with the term cancer for abstracts that have an Entrez date within the last 60 days; retrieve the first 100 PMIDs and translations; post the results on the History server and return a WebEnv and query_key :

Go to:
EPost
Base URL

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/epost.fcgi
Functions

    Uploads a list of UIDs to the Entrez History server
    Appends a list of UIDs to an existing set of UID lists attached to a Web Environment

Required Parameters
db

Database containing the UIDs in the input list. The value must be a valid Entrez database name (default = pubmed).
id

UID list. Either a single UID or a comma-delimited list of UIDs may be provided. All of the UIDs must be from the database specified by db . There is no set maximum for the number of UIDs that can be passed to epost, but if more than about 200 UIDs are to be posted, the request should be made using the HTTP POST method.

For sequence databases (nuccore, nucest, nucgss, popset, protein), the UID list may be a mixed list of GI numbers and accession.version identifiers.

 epost.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=19393038,30242208,29453458
 epost.fcgi?db=protein&id=15718680, NP_001098858.1 ,119703751

Optional Parameter
WebEnv

Web Environment. If provided, this parameter specifies the Web Environment that will receive the UID list sent by post. EPost will create a new query key associated with that Web Environment. Usually this WebEnv value is obtained from the output of a previous ESearch, EPost or ELink call. If no WebEnv parameter is provided, EPost will create a new Web Environment and post the UID list to query_key 1.

 epost.fcgi?db=protein&id=15718680,157427902,119703751&WebEnv=
 <webenv string>

Example

 esummary.fcgi?db=protein&query_key=<key>&WebEnv=<webenv string>

Optional Parameters – Retrieval
retstart

Sequential index of the first DocSum to be retrieved (default=1, corresponding to the first record of the entire set). This parameter can be used in conjunction with retmax to download an arbitrary subset of DocSums from the input set.
retmax

Total number of DocSums from the input set to be retrieved, up to a maximum of 10,000. If the total set is larger than this maximum, the value of retstart can be iterated while holding retmax constant, thereby downloading the entire set in batches of size retmax .
retmode

 efetch.fcgi?db=protein&id=15718680, NP_001098858.1 ,119703751

Special note for sequence databases.

NCBI is no longer assigning GI numbers to a growing number of new sequence records. As such, these records are not indexed in Entrez, and so cannot be retrieved using ESearch or ESummary, and have no Entrez links accessible by ELink. EFetch can retrieve these records by including their accession.version identifier in the id parameter.
Required Parameters – Used only when input is from the Entrez History server
query_key

Query key. This integer specifies which of the UID lists attached to the given Web Environment will be used as input to EFetch. Query keys are obtained from the output of previous ESearch, EPost or ELInk calls. The query_key parameter must be used in conjunction with WebEnv .
WebEnv

Web Environment. This parameter specifies the Web Environment that contains the UID list to be provided as input to EFetch. Usually this WebEnv value is obtained from the output of a previous ESearch, EPost or ELink call. The WebEnv parameter must be used in conjunction with query_key .

 efetch.fcgi?db=protein&query_key=<key>&WebEnv=<webenv string>

Optional Parameters – Retrieval
retmode

Retrieval mode. This parameter specifies the data format of the records returned, such as plain text, HMTL or XML. See Table 1 for a full list of allowed values for each database.
Table 1
Table 1

– Valid values of &retmode and &rettype for EFetch (null = empty string)
rettype

Retrieval type. This parameter specifies the record view returned, such as Abstract or MEDLINE from PubMed, or GenPept or FASTA from protein. Please see Table 1 for a full list of allowed values for each database.
retstart

Sequential index of the first record to be retrieved (default=0, corresponding to the first record of the entire set). This parameter can be used in conjunction with retmax to download an arbitrary subset of records from the input set.
retmax

Total number of records from the input set to be retrieved, up to a maximum of 10,000. Optionally, for a large set the value of retstart can be iterated while holding retmax constant, thereby downloading the entire set in batches of size retmax .
Optional Parameters – Sequence Databases
strand

Strand of DNA to retrieve. Available values are "1" for the plus strand and "2" for the minus strand.
seq_start

First sequence base to retrieve. The value should be the integer coordinate of the first desired base, with "1" representing the first base of the seqence.
seq_stop

Last sequence base to retrieve. The value should be the integer coordinate of the last desired base, with "1" representing the first base of the seqence.
complexity

Data content to return. Many sequence records are part of a larger data structure or "blob", and the complexity parameter determines how much of that blob to return. For example, an mRNA may be stored together with its protein product. The available values are as follows:

View in own window
Value of complexity 	Data returned for each requested GI
0 	entire blob
1 	bioseq
2 	minimal bioseq-set
3 	minimal nuc-prot

Functions

    Returns UIDs linked to an input set of UIDs in either the same or a different Entrez database
    Returns UIDs linked to other UIDs in the same Entrez database that match an Entrez query
    Checks for the existence of Entrez links for a set of UIDs within the same database
    Lists the available links for a UID
    Lists LinkOut URLs and attributes for a set of UIDs
    Lists hyperlinks to primary LinkOut providers for a set of UIDs
    Creates hyperlinks to the primary LinkOut provider for a single UID

Required Parameters
db

Database from which to retrieve UIDs. The value must be a valid Entrez database name (default = pubmed). This is the destination database for the link operation.
dbfrom

Database containing the input UIDs. The value must be a valid Entrez database name (default = pubmed). This is the origin database of the link operation. If db and dbfrom are set to the same database value, then ELink will return computational neighbors within that database. Please see the full list of Entrez links for available computational neighbors. Computational neighbors have linknames that begin with dbname_dbname (examples: protein_protein, pcassay_pcassay_activityneighbor).
cmd

ELink command mode. The command mode specified which function ELink will perform. Some optional parameters only function for certain values of &cmd (see below).

cmd=neighbor (default)

ELink returns a set of UIDs in db linked to the input UIDs in dbfrom.

Example: Link from protein to gene

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680,157427902

cmd=neighbor_score

ELink returns a set of UIDs within the same database as the input UIDs along with computed similarity scores .

Example: Find related articles to PMID 20210808

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&db=pubmed&id=20210808&cmd=neighbor_score

cmd=neighbor_history

ELink posts the output UIDs to the Entrez History server and returns a query_key and WebEnv corresponding to the location of the output set.

Example: Link from protein to gene and post the results on the Entrez History

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680,157427902&cmd=neighbor_history

cmd=acheck

ELink lists all links available for a set of UIDs.

Example: List all possible links from two protein GIs

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&id=15718680,157427902&cmd=acheck

Example: List all possible links from two protein GIs to PubMed

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=pubmed&id=15718680,157427902&cmd=acheck

cmd=ncheck

ELink checks for the existence of links within the same database for a set of UIDs. These links are equivalent to setting db and dbfrom to the same value.

Example: Check whether two nuccore sequences have "related sequences" links.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=nuccore&id=21614549,219152114&cmd=ncheck

cmd=lcheck

Elink checks for the existence of external links (LinkOuts) for a set of UIDs.

Example: Check whether two protein sequences have any LinkOut providers.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&id=15718680,157427902&cmd=lcheck

cmd=llinks

For each input UID, ELink lists the URLs and attributes for the LinkOut providers that are not libraries.

Example: List the LinkOut URLs for non-library providers for two pubmed abstracts.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19880848,19822630&cmd=llinks

cmd=llinkslib

For each input UID, ELink lists the URLs and attributes for all LinkOut providers including libraries.

Example: List all LinkOut URLs for two PubMed abstracts.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19880848,19822630&cmd=llinkslib

cmd=prlinks

ELink lists the primary LinkOut provider for each input UID, or links directly to the LinkOut provider's web site for a single UID if retmode is set to ref .

Example: Find links to full text providers for two PubMed abstracts.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19880848,19822630&cmd=prlinks

Example: Link directly to the full text for a PubMed abstract at the provider's web site.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19880848&cmd=prlinks&retmode=ref
Required Parameter – Used only when input is from a UID list
id

UID list. Either a single UID or a comma-delimited list of UIDs may be provided. All of the UIDs must be from the database specified by dbfrom . There is no set maximum for the number of UIDs that can be passed to ELink, but if more than about 200 UIDs are to be provided, the request should be made using the HTTP POST method.

Link from protein to gene.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680,157427902,119703751

Find related sequences (link from nuccore to nuccore).

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=nuccore&db=nuccore&id=34577062

If more than one id parameter is provided, ELink will perform a separate link operation for the set of UIDs specified by each id parameter. This effectively accomplishes "one-to-one" links and preserves the connection between the input and output UIDs.

Find one-to-one links from protein to gene.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680&id=157427902&id=119703751

For sequence databases (nuccore, nucest, nucgss, popset, protein), the UID list may be a mixed list of GI numbers and accession.version identifiers.

Find one-to-one links from protein to gene.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&id=15718680&id=NP_001098858.1&id=119703751
Required Parameters – Used only when input is from the Entrez History server
query_key

Query key. This integer specifies which of the UID lists attached to the given Web Environment will be used as input to ELink. Query keys are obtained from the output of previous ESearch, EPost or ELInk calls. The query_key parameter must be used in conjunction with WebEnv .
WebEnv

Web Environment. This parameter specifies the Web Environment that contains the UID list to be provided as input to ELink. Usually this WebEnv value is obtained from the output of a previous ESearch, EPost or ELink call. The WebEnv parameter must be used in conjunction with query_key .

 Link from protein to gene:
 elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=gene&query_key=<key>&WebEnv=<webenv string>
 
 Find related sequences (link from protein to protein):
 elink.fcgi?dbfrom=protein&db=protein&query_key=<key>&WebEnv=
 <webenv string>

Optional Parameter – Retrieval
retmode

Retrieval type. Determines the format of the returned output. The default value is ‘xml’ for ELink XML, but ‘json’ is also supported to return output in JSON format.
idtype

Specifies the type of identifier to return for sequence databases (nuccore, nucest, nucgss, popset, protein). By default, ELink returns GI numbers in its output. If idtype is set to ‘acc’, ELink will return accession.version identifiers rather than GI numbers.
Optional Parameters – Limiting the Output Set of Links
linkname

Name of the Entrez link to retrieve. Every link in Entrez is given a name of the form

dbfrom_db_subset .

The values of subset vary depending on the values of dbfrom and db . Many dbfrom/db combinations have no subset values. See the list of Entrez links for a listing of all available linknames. When linkname is used, only the links with that name will be retrieved.

The linkname parameter only functions when cmd is set to neighbor or neighbor_history .

Find all links from gene to snp.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=gene&db=snp&id=93986

Find snps with genotype data linked to genes.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=gene&db=snp&id=93986&linkname=gene_snp_genegenotype
term

Entrez query used to limit the output set of linked UIDs. The query in the term parameter will be applied after the link operation, and only those UIDs matching the query will be returned by ELink. The term parameter only functions when db and dbfrom are set to the same database value.

Find all related articles for a PMID.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&db=pubmed&id=19879512

Find all related review articles published in 2008 for a PMID.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&db=pubmed&id=19879512&term=review%5Bfilter%5D+AND+2008%5Bpdat%5Dh
holding

Name of LinkOut provider. Only URLs for the LinkOut provider specified by holding will be returned. The value provided to holding should be the abbreviation of the LinkOut provider's name found in the <NameAbbr> tag of the ELink XML output when cmd is set to llinks or llinkslib . The holding parameter only functions when cmd is set to llinks or llinkslib .

Find information for all LinkOut providers for a PMID.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&cmd=llinkslib&id=16210666

Find information from clinicaltrials.gov for a PMID.

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&cmd=llinkslib&id=16210666&holding=CTgov
Optional Parameters – Dates

These parameters only function when cmd is set to neighbor or neighbor_history and dbfrom is pubmed .
datetype

Type of date used to limit a link operation. The allowed values vary between Entrez databases, but common values are 'mdat' (modification date), 'pdat' (publication date) and 'edat' (Entrez date). Generally an Entrez database will have only two allowed values for datetype .
reldate

When reldate is set to an integer n , ELink returns only those items that have a date specified by datetype within the last n days.
mindate, maxdate

Date range used to limit a link operation by the date specified by datetype . These two parameters ( mindate, maxdate ) must be used together to specify an arbitrary date range. The general date format is YYYY/MM/DD, and these variants are also allowed: YYYY, YYYY/MM.

Required Parameters
db

Database to search. The only supported value is ‘pubmed’.
rettype

Retrieval type. The only supported value is ‘xml’.
bdata

Citation strings. Each input citation must be represented by a citation string in the following format:

journal_title|year|volume|first_page|author_name|your_key|

Multiple citation strings may be provided by separating the strings with a carriage return character (%0D). The your_key value is an arbitrary label provided by the user that may serve as a local identifier for the citation, and it will be included in the output. Be aware that all spaces must be replaced by ‘+’ symbols and that citation strings should end with a final vertical bar ‘|’.
