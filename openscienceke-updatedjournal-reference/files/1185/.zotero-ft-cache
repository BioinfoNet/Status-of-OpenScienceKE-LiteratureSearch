Abstract

An empirical Bayes (EB) pairwise F ST estimator was previously introduced and evaluated for its performance by numerical simulation. In this study, we conducted coalescent simulations and generated genetic population structure mechanistically, and compared the performance of the EB F ST with Nei's G ST , Nei and Chesser's bias‐corrected G ST ( G ST_NC ), Weir and Cockerham's θ ( θ WC ) and θ with finite sample correction ( θ WC_F ). We also introduced EB estimators for Hedrick’ G ’ ST and Jost’ D . We applied these estimators to publicly available SNP genotypes of Atlantic herring. We also examined the power to detect the environmental factors causing the population structure. Our coalescent simulations revealed that the finite sample correction of θ WC is necessary to assess population structure using pairwise F ST values. For microsatellite markers, EB F ST performed the best among the present estimators regarding both bias and precision under high gene flow scenarios (urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0001 ). For 300 SNPs, EB F ST had the highest precision in all cases, but the bias was negative and greater than those for G ST_NC and θ WC_F in all cases. G ST_NC and θ WC_F performed very similarly at all levels of F ST . As the number of loci increased up to 10 000, the precision of G ST_NC and θ WC_F became slightly better than for EB F ST for cases with urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0002 , even though the size of the bias remained constant. The EB estimators described the fine‐scale population structure of the herring and revealed that ~56% of the genetic differentiation was caused by sea surface temperature and salinity. The R package finepop for implementing all estimators used here is available on CRAN.
Introduction

Wright's F ST is the most widely used measure of genetic divergence among populations in the fields of population and evolutionary genetics (Weir & Hill 2002 ; Holsinger & Weir 2009 ), conservation and management (Palsbøll et al . 2006 ), and seascape (Selkoe et al . 2008 ) and landscape genetics (Storfer et al . 2010 ). Wright ( 1951 ) defined F ST as the correlation between randomly sampled gametes relative to the total drawn from the same population. Nei ( 1973 ) derived a formula to measure the genetic differentiation between populations denoted by G ST , which is identical to F ST (Appendix 1). The numerator of G ST represents the variance in allele frequencies between populations. Therefore, its estimate is biased, even though the estimated allele frequencies are unbiased (Appendix 2). To overcome this problem, Nei & Chesser ( 1983 ) derived unbiased estimators for the numerator and denominator of G ST , and corrected the bias in G ST (hereafter G ST_NC ). Weir & Cockerham ( 1984 ) also proposed a bias‐corrected moment estimator urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0003 for the coancestry coefficient in the analysis of variance framework. θ WC is the ratio of the unbiased estimators of the between‐population variance of allele frequencies to the total variance component and is an estimator of F ST (Weir & Cockerham 1984 ). These F ST estimators were originally developed to estimate the mean F ST over a metapopulation based on a set of population samples, which is often called global F ST (e.g. Pérez‐Lezaun et al . 1997 ). G ST considers inference on observed set of populations sampled, while θ WC considers replicates of a set of populations (Weir & Cockerham 1984 ). In addition to the global F ST , F ST values between pairs of population samples (pairwise F ST ) are routinely used to estimate population structure.

In high gene flow species, such as marine fish, the weak genetic signal of population differentiation hinders the precise estimation of population genetic parameters (Waples 1998 ). Larger sampling variances for smaller sample sizes would also make it more difficult to correctly estimate F ST . Thus, there is a high risk of obtaining biased F ST values, resulting in the detection of spurious population structures. Because allele frequencies are very similar among populations in such cases, estimation of the between‐population heterozygosity is not precise, especially when highly polymorphic markers such as microsatellite loci are used. To address this problem, we previously proposed an empirical Bayes (EB) method, which generates posterior distributions of pairwise F ST using a Dirichlet distribution [or a beta for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] based on the G ST formula (Kitada et al . 2007 ). The mean of the posterior distribution is defined as EB F ST estimator. However, the performance testing was limited to G ST , and θ WC was evaluated via a function of G ST using parametric simulations based on a Dirichlet distribution.

In this study, we explored the performance of our EB F ST estimator relative to other established methods using coalescent simulations that generate genetic population structure mechanistically. In addition, we introduced new EB estimators (hereafter EB G ST_H and EB D J ) for G ’ ST (Hedrick 2005 ; G ST_H ) and D (Jost 2008 ; D J ). We applied these estimators to publicly available data set of Atlantic herring ( Clupea harengus ) SNP genotypes and inferred the population structure. We also evaluated the power to detect environmental effects, such as those of sea temperature, salinity, and geographical distance, on the herring F ST , taking the correlation between F ST values into account based on regression analyses using bootstrapping. Atlantic herring is distributed across a wide geographical area with steep gradients of salinity and sea surface temperature from the North Sea to the inner Baltic Sea, but its F ST values were reported to be very small (Bekkevold et al . 2005 ; Gaggiotti et al . 2009 ). Thus, herring is one of the best species to test the performance of the EB estimators in high gene flow scenarios.
Materials and methods
Performance of F ST estimators by coalescent simulations

To test the performance of F ST estimators, we conducted coalescent simulations using the software ms (Hudson 2002 ) and generated genotype data under Wright's island model. The number of populations sampled was set to 30. In each population, microsatellite genotypes were obtained from 50 individuals and SNP genotypes were obtained from 25 individuals. The number of markers was set to 10 and 60 for microsatellites, and 300 and 10 000 for SNPs. We generated genotypes for eight levels of the true F ST value, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.016, 0.032, 0.064 and 0.128, which cover the extent of population differentiation from marine fish to human. The true F ST values for microsatellite genotypes were computed under the infinite allele model given by Eq.  eqn 3 in the paper by Rousset ( 1996 ) as:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0004
where γ  = (1 −  μ ) 2 , a  = (1 −  m ) 2  +  m 2 /( r  − 1), b  = (1 −  a )/( r  − 1), and d  =  a  −  b  = (1 −  m [ r /( r  − 1)]) 2 .

Here, μ is the mutation rate per generation for all alleles, m is the migration rate per generation, and r is the number of subpopulations sampled from a metapopulation. We substituted σ  = 0 for hermaphroditic populations. The true pairwise F ST values for SNP genotypes were computed as urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0005 (Wright 1951 ). In the coalescent simulations, we set the diploid population size to N 0  = 500 (which corresponds to an effective population size of N e =1 000), and the migration rate was given by urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0006 . The mutation rate for the entire microsatellite locus was set to μ  = 5 × 10 ‐5 per locus per generation to generate the mean number of alleles (~20) for marine fish (DeWoody & Avise 2000 ), which is an order of magnitude smaller than μ  = 10 −3  − 10 −4 for human microsatellites (Sun et al . 2012 ). For SNPs, we set 4 N 0 μ  = 0.3 to generate a heterozygosity value of ~0.3, which is consistent with observations of heterozygosity in Atlantic herring, namely 0.31 ± 0.01 (Limborg et al . 2012a ).

We computed pairwise F ST values for G ST , G ST_NC , θ WC and EB F ST estimators based on the generated genotype data. Additionally, we used a modified calculation of θ WC , termed θ WC_F , to account for the fixed sampling of population pairs because θ WC accounts for the replication of sampled populations ( r ). Our finite sample correction replaces a with a ( r  − 1)/ r in Eq.  eqn 2 on p. 1359 of the paper by Weir & Cockerham ( 1984 ). This was done because the pairwise F ST value is calculated for specific population pairs, so applying the fixed‐effect model of population sampling (Weir 1996 ) is appropriate. We assumed that the scale parameter ( θ ) of a Dirichlet (for microsatellite loci) or a beta (SNPs) distribution is common to all loci, but that mean allele frequencies differ for each locus in the EB F ST estimation. The scale parameter ( θ ) was estimated numerically by maximizing the marginal likelihood function under this assumption [Eq.  eqn 2 in the paper by Kitada et al . 2007 ]. The simulation procedure was replicated 10 times, and a total of B  = 10 × 30(30 − 1)/2 = 4350 pairwise F ST values were obtained for each F ST estimator. The mean bias (MB) urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0007 and root mean squared error (RMSE) urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0008 were compared.
EB estimators of other differentiation estimators

Posterior distributions for any parametric functions of gene frequencies can be generated by the EB procedure (Kitada et al . 2000 ). Therefore, the posterior distributions of the new G ST ‐related measures G ST _ H (Hedrick 2005 ) and D J (Jost 2008 ) are easily introduced as,

urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0009
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0010
respectively, where urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0011 , urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0012 , and urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0013 are the posterior distributions of urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0014 , H T , and H S , and r is the number of subpopulations sampled. These are generated from a Dirichlet and/or a beta distribution given the estimate of the Dirichlet or beta scale parameter (urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0015 ). The mean of the posterior distribution is an EB estimator of G ST _ H (EB G ST _ H ) and D J (EB D J ), and the mean of urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0016 is our EB F ST estimator.

Population structure of Atlantic herring

We analysed the publicly available SNP genotype data over the 281 loci in 21 Atlantic herring samples ( n =  607) (Limborg et al . 2012a , b ). Genotype data obtained during different years from the same sampling locations were combined because there was no difference among years (Limborg et al . 2012a ), resulting in 18 samples. The 18 sampling locations are abbreviated as follows: NOR (Norway), ICE (Iceland), SHE (Shetland), WIR (Western Ireland), CLS (Celtic Sea), IRS (Irish Sea), EC (English Channel 1999/2009), CNS (Central North Sea), RF (Ringkøbing Fjord), LIM (Limfjord), SKA (Skagerrak), KAT (Kattegat), RUG (Rügen 2003/2009), HB (Hanӧ Bay), GD (Gdansk), GR (Gulf of Riga 2002/2008), GF (Gulf of Finland) and BB (Bothnian Bay). We calculated the pairwise EB F ST , G ST_NC and θ WC_F values based on the 281 SNPs, including 16 outlier loci that were significantly correlated with environmental factors, such as annual mean temperature and salinity (Limborg et al . 2012a ). G ST was also calculated to determine the effect of the bias correction on the estimators compared with the original F ST definition. We calculated θ WC using genepop 4.2 (Raymond & Rousset 1995 ; Rousset 2008 ). We also calculated the new differentiation estimators, G ST _ H and D J ( D est in Jost 2008 ), based on the unbiased estimators of H T and H S (Nei & Chesser 1983 ), and EB G ST _ H and EB D J using finepop 1.3. Based on these pairwise F ST and the new differentiation estimates, we depicted the population structure by drawing upgma trees.
Detecting effects of environmental factors on genetic differentiation

We performed regression analyses of the pairwise F ST values against geographical distance and the differences in sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity to examine the effect of environmental variables on population differentiation using the 281 SNPs from the work of Limborg et al . ( 2012a ) (Appendix S1 , S2 , Supporting information). We evaluated the predictive power of explanatory (environmental) variables and their combinations, instead of testing correlations between each explanatory valuable and the pairwise F ST values by the partial Mantel test, to avoid the potential bias caused by correlations among the elements of distance matrices (Guillot & Rousset 2013 ). If we do not take account of correlations in F ST values between pairs of sampling points, the standard errors of the regression coefficients may be underestimated. This would result in a radical significance test of environmental variables. To overcome this problem, we conducted bootstrapping to increase the precision of the regression coefficients. We resampled locations with replacement (18 local samples, n  = 607). We also resampled the member individuals with replacement from the sampled populations.

We calculated pairwise EB F ST and θ WC_F values using finepop 1.3 for each bootstrap sample and estimated regression coefficients for the F ST values. This procedure was iterated 100 times, and the standard deviation (SD) of the regression coefficients was calculated. We then computed the Z ‐value by dividing the estimated mean coefficient by its SD for each regression coefficient. The Z ‐value follows a normal distribution N (0, 1) and therefore provides a P ‐value for the significance of each regression coefficient. All possible model combinations for the environmental explanatory variables were examined, including their interactions with EB F ST and θ WC_F . The full model was as follows:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0017
(see Table S3, Supporting information).

Here, D is the shortest ocean path, and T and S are the absolute differences in sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity between‐population pairs, respectively. The parameters β 1 , …,  β 7 are the partial regression coefficients. As the objective variables (pairwise F ST values) were correlated, the effective sample size was less than the actual number of pairs; thus, it was necessary to modify the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) with the likelihood assuming iid error terms (Akaike 1973 ) to select the explanatory variables. We used the Takeuchi Information Criterion (TIC; Takeuchi 1976 ; Burnham & Anderson 2002 ), which considers the effective sample size (Kish 1965 ; Skinner et al . 1989 ) as an extension of the AIC:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0018
where A is the variance–covariance matrix of the regression coefficients assuming iid for the error terms. B is the variance of the estimated regression coefficients based on bootstrap resampling of the locations and individual sample members. The term of trace [ A −1 B ] is the effective number of parameters. The best fit model with the minimum TIC value was selected for EB F ST and for θ WC , and we compared the performance of the two methods based on the R 2 value.

Filled circles represent medians with 95% confidence intervals. The solid lines indicate values for true F ST , and dotted lines for F ST  = 0. We generated genotypes under the Wright island model using coalescent simulations of 30 populations sampled with a sample size of 50 (for microsatellites) and 25 (for SNPs) individuals in each population, and estimated F ST between 30 × 29/2 = 435 pairs of populations based on G ST , G ST_NC , EB F ST , θ WC_F and θ WC . The procedure was repeated 10 times (see text).

For microsatellite genotypes, the mean ± SD (range) number of alleles was between 21.4 ± 4.3 (12–31) and 24.2 ± 4.7 (15–33). The results for G ST indicated the performance of the F ST estimator without bias correction, and the bias was positive (Fig.  1 a, b, Table  S1 , Supporting information). EB F ST performed the best among the estimators regarding both bias and precision when F ST ≤0.032. The bias and variance of θ WC were greater than for G ST when urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0019 , and the median of θ WC values was approximately double those of G ST_NC , θ WC_F , and EB F ST . G ST_NC and θ WC_F performed the same for all levels of F ST . The RMSE of the EB F ST estimator was half to one‐third the size of the RMSE of the other estimators for the high gene flow scenarios of urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0020 . The difference in RMSE diminishes with a decreased level of gene flow and becomes almost the same among the estimators when urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0021 . Increasing the number of loci from 10 to 60 was ineffective at reducing the bias but improved the precision for all F ST estimators.

For SNP genotypes at 300 loci, the RMSE of the EB F ST estimator was the smallest in all cases, and half or one‐third the size of those of the other estimators for the high gene flow scenarios where urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0022 , although the EB F ST estimator had greater negative bias than G ST_NC and θ WC_F (Fig.  1 c, d, Table  S2 , Supporting information). Consistent with our results obtained using microsatellite markers, the difference in RMSE diminishes with a decreased level of gene flow. Additionally, the relative bias diminishes with a decreased level of gene flow. The variance of the estimators decreased with an increase in the number of loci, whereas the bias remained constant. As a result, the unbiased estimators G ST_NC and θ WC_F may outperform the EB estimator in high‐throughput data because of the effect of shrinkage. Still, in the simulation using 10 000 loci, the RMSE of the EB F ST estimator was half that of the other estimators for a high gene flow scenario where urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0023 and comparable for scenarios with lower levels of gene flow.
Population structure of Atlantic herring

The means ± SDs of the pairwise F ST estimates were 0.01427 ± 0.00383 for G ST , 0.00619 ± 0.00357 for G ST_NC , 0.01185 ± 0.00710 for θ WC , 0.00595 ± 0.00356 for θ WC_F and 0.00482 ± 0.00050 for EB F ST (Fig.  2 a). The mean G ST (without bias correction) was 2.3 times larger than G ST_NC , 1.2 times for θ WC , 2.4 times for θ WC_F and 3.0 times for EB F ST . The mean EB F ST decreased to 41% of that of θ WC , 78% of that of G ST_NC and 81% of that of θ WC_F . The SDs for G ST , G ST_NC and θ WC_F were ~0.004 and that for θ WC was ~0.007, whereas that for EB F ST was an order of magnitude smaller (0.0005). Interestingly, the new differentiation estimators showed very similar values to F ST estimators. G ST_H values had a similar distribution to θ WC , D J was very close to θ WC_F , and EB D J was close to EB F ST (Fig.  2 a). Estimates of G ST_NC were highly correlated with those of G ST_H ( r  = 0.9999), θ WC_F ( r  = 0.9989) and D J ( r  = 0.9997) (Fig.  2 b). The EB F ST values decreased, but the correlations were quite strong with G ST_NC ( r  = 0.9550) and θ WC_F ( r  = 0.9541). The significance was very high for all combinations ( P  < 2.2e −16 ). The EB F ST values were also strongly correlated with other EB estimators ( r  > 0.99). When we fitted a linear model of y  =  αx , the proportion estimates were urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0024 for EB G ST_H and urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0025 for EB D J ( R 2  = 1, P  < 2.2e −16 ).

All estimators consistently described four large clusters, where the Baltic Sea (green) was associated with the Baltic–North Sea transition area (blue), and the North Sea (magenta)/British Isles (red) was associated with the North Atlantic (orange). An exception was G ST , which localized the Baltic Sea apart from the other three clusters (Fig.  3 a, b). All estimators identified a subcluster of SHL and CNS in the North Sea/British Isles except θ WC_F . Interestingly, G ST_NC , D J and G ST_H described the same population structure, although the differentiation for G ST_H was approximately twice as large (Fig.  3 b, c). θ WC described the same population structure, but with slight differences in the Baltic Sea. θ WC_F showed a similar pattern, with the difference that WIR associated with SHL and CNS. As for the EB estimators, EB F ST and EB D J provided the same population structure. EB G ST_H also showed almost the same pattern, but with a slight difference in the Baltic–North Sea transition area, which was consistent with G ST_NC , G ST_H , θ WC and D J .

Effects of environmental factors on genetic differentiation

The best fit model for both EB F ST and θ WC_F included geographical distance, salinity and their interaction (Model 8) (Tables  1 and S3 , Supporting information). TIC was slightly smaller when using annual mean sea surface temperature and salinity. The model fitting was much better in θ WC_F (TIC   = 314.48, R 2   = 0.61) than in EB F ST (TIC   = 329.36, R 2   = 0.56), showing that 56% of the EB F ST fine‐scale population structure (Fig.  3 b) was explained by sea surface temperature and salinity. The regression coefficients were consistent in both θ WC_F and EB F ST . Those for geographical distance were positive and highly significant, and those for salinity were also positive and significant, while interaction between geographical distance and salinity was negative and not significant.

Discussion

Our coalescent simulations revealed the need for the finite sample correction of θ WC when assessing population structure using pairwise F ST values, and demonstrated that the EB F ST estimator performed the best with respect to bias and precision in high gene flow scenarios (urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0026 ) when highly polymorphic markers, such as microsatellites, were used. For SNPs, the EB F ST estimator had greater negative bias than G ST_NC and θ WC_F , but the precision was the highest in all cases when 300 SNPs were used. However, when using 10 000 SNPs, the precision became better for G ST_NC and θ WC_F under scenarios where urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0027 . The EB F ST estimate always takes positive values based on G ST , while other estimators and their lower 95% confidence limits can take negative values when the true F ST is very small. The empirical data analyses of the Atlantic herring SNPs demonstrated that the EB F ST estimator identified fine‐scale population structure and that 56% of the genetic differentiation was explained by geographical distance and sea surface salinity. The new EB estimators, EB D J and EB G ST_H , identified the same and very similar population structures compared with that from the EB F ST estimator.

Bias‐corrected G ST_NC and θ WC_F performed very similarly at all levels of F ST . In contrast, θ WC provided pairwise F ST estimates ~2 times greater than those of G ST_NC and θ WC_F . Originally, both G ST and θ WC were developed to estimate F ST (global F ST ) in a metapopulation based on a set of randomly selected population samples. The major difference in the two estimators G ST_NC and θ WC is the bias correction under the fixed‐ and random‐effect models of population sampling (Weir 1996 ). When estimating pairwise F ST , the number of populations is two ( r  = 2 in θ WC ), which yields the correction term ( r −1) of θ WC in estimating the variance of allele frequencies over populations ( s 2 on p. 1360 in the paper by Weir & Cockerham 1984 ) as one. This should provide a between‐population variance that is twice G ST_NC , which uses r instead of r  − 1. Another difference is that θ WC considers the variance component (urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0028 ) for the third‐stage sampling of gametes in the denominator of the total variance ( a  +  b  +  c ) (see Eqs.  eqn 2-eqn 4 on p. 1359–1360 of the paper by Weir & Cockerham 1984 ). When all sample sizes ( n ) of individuals are equal ( n i  =  n ), urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0029 . Therefore, the sum of their correction term regarding urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0030 in the denominator a  +  b  +  c becomes 0. As for the numerator, urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0031 . The term urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0032 is the average heterozygote frequency, and urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0033 for n i  =  n . Therefore, the correction term urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0034 in the numerator should take small values, and the effect of the third‐stage sampling variance component could be negligible when sample sizes ( n individuals) are large enough.

In contrast, our EB F ST estimator uses the original G ST formula, and the bias is not corrected explicitly. However, the EB F ST estimator accounts for sampling variances of populations (first‐stage sampling) and individuals (second‐stage sampling) by generating the posterior distributions of allele frequencies given the observed allele counts in sampled populations. An EB estimator of a population mean and/or rate that incorporates variance component structures is useful for small‐area estimation (Ghosh & Lahiri 1987 ). The idea is to ‘borrow strength’ from related areas to find more accurate estimates for a given area or, simultaneously, for several areas. The posterior distributions of allele frequencies generated in our EB estimation procedure gain strength from the set of sampled populations and shrink towards the true allele frequencies in a metapopulation. The EB F ST can therefore be interpreted as a shrinkage estimator (Stein 1956 ). The results of our coalescent simulations suggest that the shrinkage is effective for highly polymorphic markers to correct estimates of allele frequencies even under small sample sizes, but not for SNPs because the allele frequencies of two alleles might be more precisely estimated than microsatellites given the sample size. The EB estimators, EB F ST , EB G ST _ H and EB D J , consistently identified the Atlantic herring population structure, which consisted of four large groups: (i) Baltic Sea; (ii) Baltic–North Sea transition area; (iii) North Sea/British Isles; and (iv) North Atlantic (Fig.  3 ). The population structure generally agrees with that inferred by the original study (Limborg et al . 2012a ) and that obtained from the top 156 loci among the 281 loci ranked by their contribution to divergence of the four large clusters (Bekkevold et al . 2015 ). Our EB estimators provided a finer scale population structure without any prior information.

As for the new differentiation estimators, G ST_H performed similarly to θ WC , and D J performed similarly to G ST _ NC and θ WC_F for the Atlantic herring SNPs. The observed heterozygosity ( H o ) was 0.31 ± 0.01 and was very similar in all samples [Table  1 in the paper by Limborg et al . ( 2012a )]. G ST_H (Hedrick 2005 ) and D J (Jost 2008 ) were developed for cases in which heterozygosity is high within each subpopulation but the subpopulations have significantly differentiated. In such cases, G ST takes small values even though the actual differentiation is large, especially for cases with highly polymorphic markers such as microsatellite loci. Our analysis of the high gene flow Atlantic herring using SNPs might not be an appropriate example to test the characteristics of the new differentiation estimators. However, our results of coalescent simulations should be straightforward because they are functions of G ST . There has been extensive discussion on the new differentiation measures (Heller & Siegismund 2009 ; Ryman & Leimar 2009 ; Gerlach et al . 2010 ; Leng & Zhang 2011 ; Whitlock 2011 ; Wang 2015 ). However, further study is needed for various levels of heterozygosity and genetic differentiation to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the new differentiation estimators including EB G ST_H , EB D J and EB F ST .

The R package finepop 1.3.0 implements all estimators used in this study. It can be applied to genotype/haplotype data derived from common markers, including isozymes, mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and SNPs. Accepted data formats include genepop and a frequency format for allele and haplotype frequencies in text files. The function read.genepop or read.frequency loads the data file and the population label file. EBFST calculates EB F ST values and outputs the pairwise F ST matrix. GstN , GstNC , and thetaWC.pair calculate pairwise F ST values for G ST (Nei 1973 ), G ST_NC (Nei & Chesser 1983 ) and θ WC_F ( θ WC of Weir & Cockerham ( 1984 ) with finite sample correction), respectively. GstH and DJ calculate the new differentiation measures; pairwise G ’ ST (Hedrick 2005 ) and D J (Jost 2008 ) values are based on the unbiased estimators of H T and H S (Nei & Chesser 1983 ). EBGstH and EBDJ calculate the EB estimates for them. R script used in the herring case studies is provided to exemplify usages of finepop functions (Appendix S3, Supporting Information). The function of regression analysis of genetic population structure on environmental factors will also be included in the coming version.

Appendix 1:: Relationship between G ST and F ST

Nei's G ST formula (Nei 1973 ) defines F ST between populations as:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0035 (eqn 1)
where H T and H S are the total‐population and within‐population heterozygosity values at a locus. These statistics are defined as:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0036
where m is the number of alleles and urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0037 is the frequency of allele j in population i ( i  = 1, …,  r ). Nei ( 1973 ) defined Wright's F ‐statistics as urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0038 , urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0039 and urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0040 , where H 0 is the frequency of all heterozygotes. These equations satisfy Wright's definition: urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0041 (Nei & Chesser 1983 ).

F ST is defined as ‘the correlation between random gametes, drawn from the same subpopulation, relative to the total’ (Wright 1951 ; p. 328). F ST is also defined as the ratio of the between‐population variance to the total variance of allele frequencies (e.g. Weir & Cockerham 1984 ). Here, we consider cases with multiple alleles as
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0042 (eqn 2)
where p j is the mean allele frequency of allele j , and urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0043 is the variance of allele frequencies over subpopulations.

We explicitly show the relationship between G ST and F ST between two populations ( r = 2) with multiple alleles. The numerator of G ST can be written as
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0044

H T is
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0045

Therefore, we have
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0046

The denominator of G ST can be expanded as
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0047

The second term is as follows:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0048
and we have
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0049

Thus, the denominator of G ST equals that of Eq.  eqn 2 :
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0050

In general, the variance of observed random variables x ( x 1 , …,  x n ) is expressed in Eq.  eqn 3 . Therefore, the numerator of F ST between two populations is expressed as
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0051
Thus, it was confirmed that G ST is equivalent to F ST (Eq.  eqn 1  = Eq.  eqn 2 ).

For biallelic cases ( m =2), H T  = 2 p (1 −  p ), and H T  −  H S  = ( p (1)  −  p (2) ) 2 /2. Then, we have Wright's F ST definition (Wright 1951 , 1965 ) of
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0052
where v and V ( p ) are the mean allele frequency and the variance of allele frequencies over subpopulations, respectively.
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0053 (eqn 3)

Appendix 2: Relative bias and mean square error of the numerator of the F ST estimator

We hereafter express the G ST numerator (Eq.  eqn 1 ) as urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0054 . After Taylor series expansion, we obtain the F ST estimator around the true value:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0055

Therefore,
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0056 (eqn 4)
Eqaution (4) shows that the urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0057 relative bias is determined by the relative bias of urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0058 and that of urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0059 . In the case of high gene flow, that is, when urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0060 is small, the urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0061 relative bias becomes large. Using Eq.  eqn 4 , the relative mean square error of urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0062 is decomposed as
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0063
The relative mean square error of urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0064 becomes large for higher gene flow.

The F ST estimator numerator urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0065 is expressed as the sum of the square difference in the allele frequencies between the two populations:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0066

The bias of the estimator urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0067 is explicitly given below and is the sum of the variance of the difference in allele frequencies:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0068
The urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0069 bias becomes larger for a larger number of alleles m . Because urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0070 is small in the case of high gene flow, the urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0071 relative bias becomes large.

We begin with a two‐allele case to derive the explicit formula for the relative square error:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0072

After Taylor series expansion, we obtain urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0073 around the true value:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0074

Therefore, the relative square error is calculated as:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0075
This equation shows that the relative variation in urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0076 becomes larger for higher gene flow.

In general cases with m alleles, the Taylor series expansion is as follows:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0077

The mean square error of the urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0078 denominator is as follows:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0079 (eqn 5)
where δ jj ’ is a delta function that takes 1 for j  =  j ’ and 0 for j  ≠  j ’.

Here, urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0080 and substituting them into Eq.  eqn 5 , we have the simple form for the variance of the urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0081 denominator:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0082

The relative root mean square error is obtained as:
urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0083
This equation clearly shows that the variation in urn:x-wiley:1755098X:media:men12663:men12663-math-0084 becomes larger for higher gene flow and a larger number of alleles.
