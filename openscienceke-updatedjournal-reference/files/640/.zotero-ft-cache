Abstract
Libraries in developing countries are struggling to provide information in the most efficient and effective methods of providing to their clients. This has been necessitated by the rising cost of print information resources coupled with the dwindling library budgets. In addition, space utilization has been affected due to the storage of student projects within the libraries. The purpose of the study was to determine the uptake of open access initiatives and incentives undertaken in middle level college libraries in Kenya with the view to improve delivery of information services in libraries. The study sought to establish the initiatives and incentives used to implement and sustain open access in middle level college libraries with special reference to the Kenya Institute of Management Library Network. It established the methods used to promote open access initiatives in middle level college libraries. Objectives of the study were: explore the components that determine quality and quantity of research publications, assess the impact of Open Access incentives in improving delivery of library services in an academic library, investigate ICT infrastructure and components necessary for the implementation of open access and explore the use of information literacy as a model for sensitization of open access at the Kenya Institute of Management. Nature of the study was based on a case study approach where both qualitative and quantitative were used. It targeted a total population of 155 respondents that included Librarians, senior library assistants, library assistants, school of management staff and lectures. The sample of the study was 110 respondents who were sampled through purposive sampling method. Data collection methods included use of survey questionnaires, telephone interviews. Qualitative and quantitative data was analyzed and involved the application of tables and pie chart. The study found out that middle level libraries could improve the quality and quantity of research by use of policies, availing local content research as an incentive for publishing in open access, implementation of an institutional repository, application of various ICT components such as good intranet and networking system, use of webometrics in raising the impact factor of research. Thus, the study proposed several recommendations which included; more research should be conducted on open access in middle level colleges’ more advocation of open access should be provided through information literacy, the library should initiate publishing of research in open access institutional repository and to establish a publishing department.
