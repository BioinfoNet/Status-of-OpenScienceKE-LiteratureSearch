Elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. The speed and accuracy of MUSCLE are compared with T-Coffee, MAFFT and CLUSTALW on four test sets of reference alignments: BAliBASE, SABmark, SMART and a new benchmark, PREFAB. MUSCLE achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. Without refinement, MUSCLE achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from T-Coffee and MAFFT, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. The MUSCLE program, source code and PREFAB test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":11981477,"mean":7.5117719716532,"rank":429422,"pct":96,"higher_than":11553943},"journal":{"count":20167,"mean":5.0476287811167,"rank":224,"pct":98,"higher_than":19945},"similar_age_3m":{"count":95852,"mean":6.4158666680578,"rank":3013,"pct":96,"higher_than":92839},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":162,"mean":2.9624720496894,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":161}},"authors":["R.
