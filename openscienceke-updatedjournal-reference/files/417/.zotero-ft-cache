Abstract

This study seeks to understand the existing interactions between actors of the Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI), and how the actors’ interests are aligning to achieve openness and transparency of government operations. This study is based on the Callon’s moments of translation framework, which helps in describing the interaction between initiators of a network and other involved actors with the aim of aligning their diverse interests in order to achieve a common goal. KODI comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders from government, private sector, inter-governmental organisation, and civil society. KODI has faced various challenges since its inception in 2011, some of which include lack of adequate resources, reduced support from some of the stakeholders, and a shift in government buy-in into the initiative. This caused the initiative to stall for a period of almost two years between the year 2012 and 2013, which suggests a disconnect in the interests of some of the key actors at the time. A description of the strategies applied by the network initiators to resuscitate the initiative is provided. This also includes a description of how the interests of the various actors were aligned to achieve a common cause. The study is explanatory, and results in a practical contribution describing the strategies that can help in securing buy-in of an open government data initiative.
