Current approaches either rely on simple sequence similarity thresholds (OTU-picking) or on complex and compute-intensive evolutionary models. The OTU-picking methods scale well on large datasets, but the results are highly sensitive to the similarity threshold. Coalescent-based species delimitation approaches often rely on Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and can therefore only be applied to small datasets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":12023633,"mean":7.5167196189821,"rank":1594718,"pct":86,"higher_than":10425591},"journal":{"count":7976,"mean":6.8462846394984,"rank":2007,"pct":74,"higher_than":5962},"similar_age_3m":{"count":146931,"mean":7.53568284217,"rank":20025,"pct":86,"higher_than":126866},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":146,"mean":6.2168965517241,"rank":38,"pct":73,"higher_than":108}},"authors":["Jiajie Zhang","Paschalia Kapli","Pavlos Pavlidis","Alexandros Stamatakis"],"type":"article","handles":[],"altmetric_id":1724949,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":14,"cited_by_tweeters_count":11,"cited_by_accounts_count":13,"last_updated":1383817842,"score":8.35,"history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.35},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt499","added_on":1378154389,"published_on":1377734400,"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Mathematics"],"readers":{"citeulike":"2","mendeley":"774","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":776,"images":{"small":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=9&types=tttttttg","medium":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=9&types=tttttttg","large":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=9&types=tttttttg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1724949"})
