Abstract 
 
DNA-barcoding, using the mitochondrial marker COI, has been found successful for the identification of specimens in many animal groups, but may not be suited for species discovery and delimitation if used alone. In this study, we investigate whether two observed COI haplogroups in the earthworm Aporrectodea longa correspond to two cryptic species or if the variation is intraspecific. This is done by complementing COI with two nuclear markers, ITS2 and Histone 3. The variation is studied using distance methods, parsimony networks and Bayesian coalescent trees, and the statistical distinctness of the groups is tested on gene trees using the genealogical sorting index, Rosenberg’s P AB and Rodrigo et al.’s P (RD) . We also applied multilocus species delimitation based on the multispecies coalescence model. The two haplogroups were found in COI , and all tests except P (RD) found them to be significantly distinct. However, in ITS2, the same groups were not recovered in any analyses or tests. H3 was invariable in A. longa , and was, therefore, included only in the multilocus analysis, which preferred a model treating A. longa as one species over a model splitting it into two. We also compared two measurements of size, body length, and no. of segments between the groups. No difference in body length was found, and although a significant difference in no. of segments was noted the haplogroup with the lower mean showed both the highest and the lowest value. When combined, these results led us to the conclusion that there is no support for the separation of A. longa into two cryptic species. This study again highlights the importance of complementing mitochondrial barcodes with more data when establishing species boundaries.

Introduction 
 
DNA barcoding facilitates identification of organisms, by matching the sequence of a short standardized marker for identification, for animals a part of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI), with a reference library (Hebert et al., 2003 Hebert PD , Cywinska A , Ball SL , Dewaard JR. ( 2003 ). Biological identifications through DNA barcodes. Proc Biol Sci 270: 313 – 21 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). This approach has been found successful in many animal groups (Waugh, 2007 Waugh J. ( 2007 ). DNA barcoding in animal species: Progress, potential and pitfalls. Bioessays 29: 188 – 97 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). It has been proven good for matching specimens of different life stages and/or sexes and thereby increasing the number of individuals that can be identified to species level compared with only using morphology, where often only adults, and in cases with non-hermaphroditic animals, where often only one sex can be reliably identified (Ekrem et al., 2010 Ekrem T , Stur E , Hebert PDN. ( 2010 ). Females do count: Documenting Chironomidae (Diptera) species diversity using DNA barcoding. Org Divers Evol 10: 397 – 408 .

Exploring unknown life stages of Arctic Tanytarsini (Diptera: Chironomidae) with DNA barcoding. Zootaxa 2743: 27 – 39 .   [Google Scholar] ). However, the usefulness of DNA barcoding depends on the existence of a good reference library to match the unknown sequences, and the importance of taking intra-specific variation into account should not be underestimated (Bergsten et al., 2012 Bergsten J , Bilton DT , Fujisawa T , Elliott M , Monaghan MT , Balke M , Hendrich L , et al. ( 2012 ). The effect of geographical scale of sampling on DNA barcoding. Syst Biol 61: 851 – 69 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Ekrem et al., 2007 Ekrem T , Willassen E , Stur E. ( 2007 ). A comprehensive DNA sequence library is essential for identification with DNA barcodes. Mol Phylogenet Evol 43: 530 – 42 .

A critical view of the sufficiency of zoological DNA barcoding databases and a plea for broader integration of taxonomic knowledge. Mol Phylogenet Evol 69: 39 – 45 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). DNA barcoding has been shown to be beneficial for the studies of earthworms and other clitellates; it has been used to study invasive species (Martinsson et al., 2015 Martinsson S , Cui Y , Martin PJ , Pinder A , Quinlan K , Wetzel MJ , Erséus C. ( 2015 ). DNA-barcoding of invasive European earthworms (Clitellata: Lumbricidae) in south-western Australia. Biol Invasions 17: 2527 – 32 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Porco et al., 2013 Porco D , Decaëns T , Deharveng L , James S , Skarżyński D , Erséus C , Butt K , et al. ( 2013 ).

[Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), to test model organisms used in ecotoxicology (Römbke et al., 2015 Römbke J , Aira M , Backeljau T , Breugelmans K , Domínguez J , Funke E , Graf N , et al. ( 2015 ). DNA barcoding of earthworms ( Eisenia fetida/andrei complex) from 28 ecotoxicological test laboratories. Appl Soil Ecol in press. [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), and together with other data, it has been used to discover cryptic species (King et al., 2008 King RA , Tibble AL , Symondson WO. ( 2008 ). Opening a can of worms: Unprecedented sympatric cryptic diversity within British lumbricid earthworms. Mol Ecol 17: 4684 – 98 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; James et al., 2010 James SW , Porco D , Decaens T , Richard B , Rougerie R , Erséus C. ( 2010 ).

[Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Martinsson & Erséus, 2014 Martinsson S , Erséus C. ( 2014 ). Cryptic diversity in the well-studied terrestrial worm Cognettia sphagnetorum (Clitellata: Enchytraeidae). Pedobiology 57: 27 – 35 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). However, when studying species boundaries and delimiting of taxa, using COI alone is known to often overestimate the number of species, and then more data are needed to confirm the result of DNA barcoding (Dasmahapatra et al., 2010 Dasmahapatra KK , Elias M , Hill RI , Hoffman JI , Mallet J. ( 2010 ). Mitochondrial DNA barcoding detects some species that are real, and some that are not. Mol Ecol Resour 10: 264 – 73 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). This has also been found to be the case for some clitellates (Achurra & Erséus, 2013 Achurra A , Erséus C. ( 2013 ). DNA barcoding and species delimitation: The Stylodrilus heringianus case (Annelida: Clitellata: Lumbriculidae). Invertebr Syst 27: 118 – 28 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Martinsson et al., 2013 Martinsson S , Achurra A , Svensson M , Erséus C. ( 2013 ).

[Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). One of the most commonly used additional markers is, the whole or a part of, the ITS (internally transcribed spacer) region, consisting of ITS1, 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene (5.8S) and ITS2, and which has been found useful for species identification and delimitation of animals, as well as other organisms (Blouin, 2002 Blouin MS. ( 2002 ). Molecular prospecting for cryptic species of nematodes: Mitochondrial DNA versus internal transcribed spacer. Int J Parasitol 32: 527 – 31 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Yao et al., 2010 Yao H , Song J , Liu C , Luo K , Han J , Li Y , Pang Y , et al. ( 2010 ). Use of ITS2 region as the universal DNA barcode for plants and animals. PLoS One 5: e13102 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). Due to its usefulness, ITS has been suggested as the standard barcoding region for fungi (Schoch et al., 2012 Schoch CL , Seifert KA , Huhndorf S , Robert V , Spouge JL , Levesque CA , Chen W , Fungal barcoding Consortium. ( 2012 ). Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region as a universal DNA barcode marker for Fungi. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109: 6241 – 6 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), and ITS2 has been suggested as a complementary locus for the identification of animals along with the standard COI barcode (Yao et al., 2010 Yao H , Song J , Liu C , Luo K , Han J , Li Y , Pang Y , et al. ( 2010 ). Use of ITS2 region as the universal DNA barcode for plants and animals. PLoS One 5: e13102 [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). Another, possible additional marker is Histone 3 (H3), a more slowly evolving marker, and which has been used to study species boundaries in various animal groups (Martinsson & Erséus, 2014 Martinsson S , Erséus C. ( 2014 ). Cryptic diversity in the well-studied terrestrial worm Cognettia sphagnetorum (Clitellata: Enchytraeidae). Pedobiology 57: 27 – 35 .

During the course of a study of earthworm diversity in Scandinavia using DNA barcoding, the senior author (C. E.) found large genetic diversity within the morphospecies Aporrectodea longa (Ude, 1885 Ude H. ( 1885 ). Über die Rückenporen der terricolen Oligochaeten, nebst Beiträgen zur Histologie des Leibesschlauches und zur Systematik der Lumbriciden. Z Wiss Zool 43: 87 – 143 .   [Google Scholar] ) (Lumbricidae). This taxon comprises two COI haplogroups, with genetic distances of up to 7–8% between each other. Aporrectodea longa is an anecic earthworm, i.e., a species that makes deep vertical burrows, and it feeds on litter from the surface and organic material in the soil (Brown et al., 2000 Brown GG , Barois I , Lavelle P. ( 2000 ). Regulation of soil organic matter dynamics and microbial activity in the drilosphere and the role of interactions with other edaphic functional domains. Eur J Soil Biol 36: 177 – 98 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). The species is widespread in northern and central Europe and introduced to North America and Australasia (Sims & Gerard, 1985 Sims RW , Gerard BM . ( 1985 ). Earthworms: Keys and notes for the identification and study of the species. London : Brill .   [Google Scholar] ). At least two more mitochondrial lineages identified as A. longa are found in GenBank. However, at least one of them seems to consist of misidentified A. nocturna . If these lineages are included in A. longa , the species would be paraphyletic vis-a-vis at least A . giardi , but probably also to A. nocturna (Dominguez et al., 2015 Dominguez J , Aira M , Breinholt JW , Stojanovic M , James SW , Perez-Losada M. ( 2015 ). Underground evolution: New roots for the old tree of lumbricid earthworms. Mol Phylogenet Evol 83: 7 – 19 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Fernandez et al., 2012 Fernandez R , Almodovar A , Novo M , Simancas B , Diazcosin DJ. ( 2012 ). Adding complexity to the complex: New insights into the phylogeny, diversification and origin of parthenogenesis in the Aporrectodea caliginosa species complex (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae). Mol Phylogenet E 64: 368 – 79 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). Due to this, in this study, we assume that A. longa sensu (Ude, 1885 Ude H. ( 1885 ). Über die Rückenporen der terricolen Oligochaeten, nebst Beiträgen zur Histologie des Leibesschlauches und zur Systematik der Lumbriciden. Z Wiss Zool 43: 87 – 143 .   [Google Scholar] ), originally described from Germany, is the lineage that is the sister-group to A. giardi , i.e., the two groups that are found in Scandinavia. 
 
The aim of this study is to test whether the two observed haplogroups represent different species, or if this is a case of deep sympatric intraspecific divergence. We will complement the COI data with two nuclear markers, the Internally Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and Histone 3 (H3). We will analyze the data sets alone using parsimony haplotype networks and Bayesian coalescent trees, on which we will statistically test the distinctness of the two haplogroups. Moreover, in a mutilocus approach, we will use the multispecies coalescence (MSC) to test if the groups belong to the same species or not. Lastly, we will test whether the specimens of the two haplogroups of A. longa differ in body size. If the haplogroups represent different species, we expect that the two COI clusters are well separated in both the tree and the haplotype network, and that the groups are significantly distinct. In the nuclear datasets, we expect the two groups to be at least significantly sorted, but preferably reciprocally monophyletic. We also expect the MSC analysis to prefer a model where the haplogroups are treated as two species over one that treats them as one. If we do not observe this, we will not be able to reject the null hypothesis that A. longa constitutes a single species. 
Material and methods 
Sampling 
 
This study includes 34 specimens of A. longa collected in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark during 2008–2015. Collection information is listed in Table 1 . The specimens were selected from a much larger set of specimens DNA barcoded during CE’s study of Scandinavian earthworms. We include all available individuals of haplogroup 1, which is the rarer of the two groups, as well as a good representation of the COI diversity of haplogroup 2, in cases where both groups were found at the same locality, specimens of both groups were included. All specimens are preserved in 95% ethanol as physical vouchers. The vouchers are deposited in the Swedish museum of Natural History (SMNH), Stockholm, Sweden, and in the University Museum of Bergen (ZMBN), Bergen, Norway; see Table 1 for voucher numbers.

DNA sequencing and assembly 
 
DNA was extracted from a small piece of the body wall taken from the posterior part of each specimen. The DNA was extracted either using Epicentre’s QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution 1.0 or Qiagen’s DNeasyBlood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The genetic markers were amplified using PCR with the primers and programs listed in Table S1. The PCR was carried out as a 25 μl reaction. To confirm amplification, the PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel. The PCR products were purified using 5 μl ExoTAP (Exonuclease I and FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase) (Werle et al., 1994 Werle E , Schneider C , Renner M , Volker M , Fiehn W. ( 1994 ). Convenient single-step, one tube purification of PCR products for direct sequencing. Nucleic Acids Res 22: 4354 – 5 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). Sequencing was carried out by Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany) or Macrogen (Geumcheon-Gu, Seoul, Korea). One specimen (CE10419) was handled by the Canadian Center for DNA Barcoding (CCDB; Guelph, Canada), with data stored at the Barcoding of Life Data Systems (BOLD), for these specimens, only the COI sequence is available. Sequences were assembled into consensus sequences using Geneious v.7.1.8 (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). The sequences of each marker were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2002 Katoh K , Misawa K , Kuma K , Miyata T. ( 2002 ). MAFFT: A novel method for rapid multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform. Nucleic Acids Res 30: 3059 – 66 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ) as implemented in Geneious v. 7.1.8. In the ITS2 dataset, several individuals showed clear sign of heterozygosity, i.e., showing distinct double peaks on certain positions in the chromatograms. Due to this, we separated the ITS2 alleles using the PHASE algorithm (Stephens & Donnelly, 2003 Stephens M , Donnelly P. ( 2003 ). A comparison of Bayesian methods for haplotype reconstruction from population genotype data. Am J Hum Genet 73: 1162 – 9 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Stephens et al., 2001 Stephens M , Smith NJ , Donnelly P. ( 2001 ). A new statistical method for haplotype reconstruction from population data. Am J Hum Genet 68: 978 – 89 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ) as implemented in DNAsp v.5.10 (Librado & Rozas, 2009 Librado P , Rozas J. ( 2009 ). DnaSP v5: A software for comprehensive analysis of DNA polymorphism data. Bioinformatics 25: 1451 – 2 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), the phasing was run for 100 iterations after 100 initial burn-in iterations, with a thinning interval of 1 using default settings. For homozygous specimens, only one of the two identical haplotypes was kept. All sequences are deposited in GenBank; see Table 1 for accession numbers. 
Distance analyses 
 
Pairwise genetic distances were calculated for the COI and ITS2 datasets (the H3 sequences were identical for all specimens; see results) in MEGA v.6.06 (Tamura et al., 2013 Tamura K , Stecher G , Peterson D , Filipski A , Kumar S. ( 2013 ). MEGA6: Molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 6.0. Mol Biol Evol 30: 2725 – 9 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ) using uncorrected p -distances. The distances were analyzed using the online version of Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, ABGD ( http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/abgd/abgdweb.html ) (Puillandre et al., 2012 Puillandre N , Lambert A , Brouillet S , Achaz G. ( 2012 ). ABGD, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery for primary species delimitation. Mol Ecol 21: 1864 – 77 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ) with default settings in order to delimit clusters, and visualized as ranked genetic distances ( Figure 1 ). ABGD delimits genetic clusters by detecting a significant gap in the pairwise distance distribution. If there is a gap in the distribution, the lower distance values are presumed to reflect intraspecific difference and the higher values to reflect the interspecific differences.

Haplotype networks 
 
Parsimony haplotype networks were constructed for the COI and ITS2 datasets using the Median-joining method (Bandelt et al., 1999 Bandelt HJ , Forster P , Röhl A. ( 1999 ). Median-joining networks for inferring intraspecific phylogenies. Mol Biol Evol 16: 37 – 48 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ) as implemented in PopART v.1 (Leigh & Bryant, 2015 Leigh JW , Bryant D. ( 2015 ). Popart: Full-feature software for haplotype network construction. Method Ecol Evol 6: 1110 – 16 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), with epsilon set to 0. 
Coalescent analyses 
 
Gene trees for COI and ITS2 were estimated under the null hypothesis that all specimens belong to a single species, using Bayesian coalescent analysis, as implemented in the BEAST package (Drummond & Rambaut, 2007 Drummond AJ , Rambaut A. ( 2007 ). BEAST: Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees. BMC Evol Biol 7: 214 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Drummond et al., 2012 Drummond AJ , Suchard MA , Xie D , Rambaut A. ( 2012 ). Bayesian phylogenetics with BEAUti and the BEAST 1.7. Mol Biol Evol 29: 1969 – 73 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). Xml input files were created in BEAUTI v1.8.2 (Drummond et al., 2012 Drummond AJ , Suchard MA , Xie D , Rambaut A. ( 2012 ). Bayesian phylogenetics with BEAUti and the BEAST 1.7. Mol Biol Evol 29: 1969 – 73 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), using the HKY + Γ+I model for both markers. The following settings were used for all analyses: base frequencies ‘estimated’ clock model ‘lognormal relaxed clock (uncorrelated)’; tree prior ‘coalescent/constant size’; UPGMA starting tree; constant.popsize ‘lognormal: Log(Mean) = 0.0, Log(Stdev) = 1.0, offset = 0.0’. In the COI analysis, the Ucld.stdev was set to “normal” with a mean = 1.0, Stdev = 1.0. For all other priors, default settings were used. The analyses were run in BEAST v.1.8.2 (Drummond & Rambaut, 2007 Drummond AJ , Rambaut A. ( 2007 ). BEAST: Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees. BMC Evol Biol 7: 214 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Drummond et al., 2012 Drummond AJ , Suchard MA , Xie D , Rambaut A. ( 2012 ). Bayesian phylogenetics with BEAUti and the BEAST 1.7. Mol Biol Evol 29: 1969 – 73 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). Analyses were run for 50 million generations, sampling every 5000th generation. Tracer v. 1.5 (Rambaut & Drummond, 2007 Rambaut A , Drummond AJ . ( 2007 ). Tracerv1.5. Available at: http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer (last accessed April 05, 2013).   [Google Scholar] ) was used for examining the effective sample size (ESS) for parameters and determining the burn-in. Trees and posterior probabilities were summarized using TreeAnnotator v. 1.7.5 (Drummond & Rambaut, 2007 Drummond AJ , Rambaut A. ( 2007 ). BEAST: Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees. BMC Evol Biol 7: 214 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ) and showed on the Maximum clade credibility tree, discarding the first 10% as burn-in. The trees were drawn in FigTree v.1.3.1 (Rambaut, 2009) and further edited in Adobe Illustrator. 
Molecular species delimitation 
 
In order to test if the two haplogroups were significantly separated, the Maximum clade credibility tree for COI was imported into Geneious where the species delimitation plug-in (Masters et al., 2011 Masters BC , Fan V , Ross HA. ( 2011 ). Species delimitation – A geneious plugin for the exploration of species boundaries. Mol Ecol Resour 11: 154 – 7 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ) was used to calculate P ( Randomly Distinct ) ( P (RD) ), which tests if random coalescent events could explain the observed distinctiveness of a group (Rodrigo et al., 2008 Rodrigo A , Bertels F , Heled J , Noder R , Shearman H , Tsai P. ( 2008 ). The perils of plenty: What are we going to do with all these genes? Philos Trans R Soc Lond, B, Biol Sci 363: 3893 – 902 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), and Rosenberǵs P AB , which tests the probability for reciprocal monophyly of the clusters under random branching (Rosenberg, 2007 Rosenberg NA. ( 2007 ). Statistical tests for taxonomic distinctiveness from observations of monophyly. Evolution 61: 317 – 23 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). As groups corresponding to the two mitochondrial haplogroups were not recovered in the ITS2 tree (see Results section), the tests could not be performed on that tree. We also tested whether the specimens in the mitochondrial groups were significantly sorted, by calculating the genealogical sorting index ( gsi ) (Cummings et al., 2008 Cummings MP , Neel MC , Shaw KL. ( 2008 ). A genealogical approach to quantifying lineage divergence. Evolution 62: 2411 – 22 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), on a thinned section of trees from the posterior of the COI and ITS2 analyses in BEAST. The samples were thinned using LogCombiner v.1.8.2. (Drummond et al., 2012 Drummond AJ , Suchard MA , Xie D , Rambaut A. ( 2012 ). Bayesian phylogenetics with BEAUti and the BEAST 1.7. Mol Biol Evol 29: 1969 – 73 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ) sampling the trees every 500 000 generation, discarding the first 10% as burn-in, resulting in a sample of 90 trees from the posterior distribution for each gene. The gsi was calculated using an online web service (available at http://www.genealogicalsorting.org /). It was calculated for each haplogroup, using all 90 trees and tested by permutation, using 10 000 iterations. 
Multilocus species delimitation 
 
For this analysis, we complemented our three datasets with sequences from a specimen of Aporrectodea caliginosa (CE4972) to function as an out-group, as well as a positive control; unfortunately, we have no genetic data for the assumed sister-species to A. longa , i.e., A. giardi . Bayesian species delimitation was conducted using the program BPP v3.1 (Yang, 2015 Yang Z. ( 2015 ). A tutorial of BPP for species tree estimation and species delimitation. Curr Zool 61: 854 – 65 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). The method uses the multispecies coalescent model to compare different models of species delimitation in a Bayesian framework, accounting for incomplete lineage sorting due to ancestral polymorphism and gene tree-species tree conflicts (Rannala & Yang, 2013 Rannala B , Yang Z. ( 2013 ). Improved reversible jump algorithms for Bayesian species delimitation. Genetics 194: 245 – 53 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Yang & Rannala, 2010 Yang Z , Rannala B. ( 2010 ). Bayesian species delimitation using multilocus sequence data.

Unguided species delimitation using DNA sequence data from multiple Loci. Mol Biol Evol 31: 3125 – 35 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). We analyzed the data using a fixed species tree [(( longa1 , longa2 ), caliginosa ))], using species delimitation algorithm 0 (Yang & Rannala, 2010 Yang Z , Rannala B. ( 2010 ). Bayesian species delimitation using multilocus sequence data. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107: 9264 – 9 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] , Equations (3) and (4)) with ɛ = 2. The population size parameters ( θ s) were assigned the gamma prior G (2, 100), with mean 2/100 = 0.02. The divergence time at the root of the species tree (τ0) was assigned the gamma prior G (2, 50), while the other divergence time parameters were assigned the Dirichlet prior (Yang & Rannala, 2010 Yang Z , Rannala B. ( 2010 ). Bayesian species delimitation using multilocus sequence data. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107: 9264 – 9 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] , Equation (2)). The analysis was run for 200 000 generation with a burn-in of 10 000 generations and a sample frequency of 5. The analysis was run three times to confirm consistency between runs. 
Morphological study 
 
Two measurements of size, number of segments, and body length (of preserved specimens) were compared between the two groups. Only fully mature specimens with well-developed clitellum were included; therefore, only five individuals of cluster 1 and 12 individuals from cluster 2 were measured. The characters were studied on specimens preserved in 95% ethanol using a dissection microscope. The two characters were statistically analyzed using a two sample t -test, assuming unequal variance, performed in Microsoft Excel 2010. The result is visualized with univariate boxplots (as recommended by Weissgerber et al., 2015 Weissgerber TL , Milic NM , Winham SJ , Garovic VD. ( 2015 ).

Results 
DNA sequencing 
 
For all 34 specimens, COI was successfully sequenced, for H3, 33 specimens, and for ITS2, 32 specimens were successfully sequenced ( Table 1 ). After phasing, the ITS2 dataset consists of 50 sequences. After trimming, the COI dataset consists of 612 base pairs (bp), whereof 59 positions are variable; the H3 dataset consists of 333 bp, whereof none is variable; the ITS2 dataset consists of 493 bp, whereof eight positions are variable. As only a single haplotype was found for H3, this gene was only included in the mutilocus species delimitation analysis. 
Distance analyses 
 
For COI , the maximum pairwise distance within A. longa was 7.8%. The distances within the two groups were between 0.0 and 2.0%, and the distances between them were between 6.4 and 7.8% ( Figure 1A ), meaning that a barcoding gap was observed between 2.0 and 6.4% pairwise distances. The ABGD analysis for COI found two groups, corresponding to the two haplogroups. For ITS2, the maximum pairwise distance was 1.4%. and there was a continuous variation between 0 and 1.4% ( Figure 1B ), but the ABGD analysis found only a single group. 
Haplotype networks 
 
The COI haplotype network ( Figure 2A ) consists of 12 haplotypes, and the two haplogroups are well separated, with group 1 containing three haplotypes and group 2 containing nine haplotypes. The ITS2 haplotype network ( Figure 2B ) consists of 15 haplotypes, whereof six are shared between specimens of the two COI haplogroups, three are unique for group 1 and six are unique for group 2.

Bayesian coalescent analyses 
 
In both the COI and ITS2 analyses, the effective sample size (ESS) was large for most parameters. The COI tree ( Figure 3A ) shows the two haplogroups as reciprocally monophyletic; however, only group 1 is well supported (pp. 0.95), whereas group 2 has low support (pp. 0.52). In the ITS2 tree ( Figure 3B ), the two groups suggested by COI were not found monophyletic, all supported clades include sequences from both groups, and in many cases, the two ITS2 alleles from the same individual were found in different clades as well.

Species delimitation tests 
 
The result from the P (RD) species delimitation test of the two groups in the COI tree was not significant, with a p value of 0.10 for group 1 and a p value of 0.13 four group 2. However, the Rosenberǵs P AB species delimitation test gave a result that was highly significant with a value of 1.1E  −   10 . The species delimitation tests were not performed on the ITS2 tree because the two groups suggested by COI were not found monophyletic, and the test could, therefore, not be performed on these groups. The gsi T (the weighted combined gsi for all trees) for COI was 0.9931 for group 1 and 0.9375 for group 2, both groups were highly significantly sorted ( p = 1E  −   04 for both groups). For ITS2, the gsi T , for group 1, was 0.126 and for group 2, it was 0.0477, none of the groups were significantly sorted ( p  = 0.8121 and p  = 0.9614, respectively). 
Multilocus species delimitation 
 
All three runs of the BPP analysis had maximum support (PP = 1) for A. longa being a species separate from A. caliginosa. The analysis preferred the two species model, in which A. longa forms only one species, over the three species model in which the two haplogroups of A. longa are treated as two different species, with varying support (PP = 0.60–0.66) between runs. 
Morphological study 
 
The length of the specimens of COI haplogroup 1 was 11.5–14.5 cm (mean 12.74), and of those of haplogroup 2 was 10.5–14.5 cm (mean 12.67) ( Figure 4A ). There is no significant difference between the two groups ( p   = 0.9159). The number of segments varied between 193 and 208 (mean 201.2) in haplogroup 1 and between 152 and 214 (mean 182.2) in haplogroup 2 ( Figure 4B ). The difference between the two groups is significant ( p  = 0.0044)

Discussion 
 
In this study, we have found that the two mt-haplogroups within Aporrectodea longa are well separated in COI, with the existence of a barcoding-gap of 4.4% uncorrected p -distance. Group 1 is well supported in the gene-tree, and group 2 is recovered but with low support. In the statistical tests performed, we found that the two groups are significantly sorted ( gsi ) and that their reciprocal monophyly is not due to random branching ( Rosenberg’s P AB ), however, we cannot reject random coalescent as the cause for the observed distinctness of the two groups ( P (RD) ). Finding support for the existence of two groups in COI is not surprising as it was the observation of this separation that initiated this study. The barcoding-gap seen in COI is more than twice the variation within the clusters, however, it is still small compared with what is often found between species of clitellates (Gustafsson et al., 2009 Gustafsson DR , Price DA , Erséus C. ( 2009 ). Genetic variation in the popular lab worm Lumbriculus variegatus (Annelida: Clitellata: Lumbriculidae) reveals cryptic speciation. Mol Phylogenet Evol 51: 182 – 9 .

[Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Martinsson & Erséus, 2014 Martinsson S , Erséus C. ( 2014 ).

Cryptic diversity among the achaetous Marionina (Annelida, Clitellata, Enchytraeidae). Syst Biodivers 10: 509 – 25 . [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). In ITS2, the two groups were not found separated by any of the methods and tests used, and we have no support for separation or sorting in this nuclear marker. The other nuclear marker used in this study, H3, showed no variation at all and could, therefore, not be analyzed alone. In the Multilocus species delimitation analysis (BPP), we found that the model treating A. longa as a single species was preferred over one splitting the two haplogroups into two species. Based on the results mentioned above, we conclude that we have no genetic support for proposing a split of A. longa into two species. 
 
The difference between the markers could be due to the faster mutation rate and a faster lineage sorting of the mitochondrial genome compared with the nuclear one (Brown et al., 1979 Brown WM , George M , Wilson Jr AC. ( 1979 ). Rapid evolution of animal mitochondrial DNA. PNAS 76: 1967 – 71 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Neigel & Avise, 1986 Neigel JE , Avise JC . ( 1986 ). Phylogenetic relationships of mitochondrial DNA under various demographic models of speciation . In: Nevo E , Karlin S , editors. Evolutionary processes and theory. New York : Academic Press . [Crossref] ,   [Google Scholar] ). However, we did not see any sorting in the ITS2 trees, and if the two groups suggested by COI were the result of a recent speciation event we would still expect to see some degree of sorting in ITS2 even if not complete. The two statistical tests performed to test if chance can be rejected as the cause of the observed tree-structure, P (RD) and P AB gave conflicting result, P AB gave high significance for that the two group’s reciprocal monophyly are not caused by random branching, whereas P (RD) did not reject the possibility that the distinctness of the two groups is due to random coalescence. As noted in at least one other study on clitellates (Martinsson et al., 2013 Martinsson S , Achurra A , Svensson M , Erséus C. ( 2013 ). Integrative taxonomy of the freshwater worm Rhyacodrilus falciformis s.l. (Clitellata: Naididae), with the description of a new species. Zool Scripta 42: 612 – 22 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), the Rosenberg's P AB statistic seems to be more liberal than P (RD) . 
 
We find a statistical difference in one of the two measurements of size used, the number of segments, group 1 having a higher mean than group 2, but both the highest and lowest values are found in group 2, which thus is more variable then group 1. As the sample sizes are small and the measurements overlap, it is hard to know if the statistical difference is biologically significant. In another earthworm species, Octolasion tyrtaeum (Savigny, 1826), two morphs differing in size, was also found to differ in mt-DNA (Heethoff et al., 2004 Heethoff M , Etzold K , Scheu S. ( 2004 ). Mitochondrial COII sequences indicate that the parthenogenetic earthworm Octolasion tyrtaeum (Savigny 1826) constitutes of two lineages differing in body size and genotype. Pedobiologia 48: 9 – 13 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). However, a more recent study has found that the mt-DNA clades in this taxon are not always correlated with size (Shekhovtsov et al., 2014 Shekhovtsov SV , Golovanova EV , Peltek SE. ( 2014 ). Genetic diversity of the earthworm Octolasion tyrtaeum (Lumbricidae, Annelida). Pedobiologia 57: 245 – 50 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), and it is possible that this would be the case also for A. longa if a larger sample from a broader geographical area were analyzed. In another case, statistical differences in body size was found between Lumbricus terrestris and L. herculeus , that forms a cryptic species pair, but in that case, the genetic differences are much larger, with a mean COI distance between them of over 17% (James et al., 2010 James SW , Porco D , Decaens T , Richard B , Rougerie R , Erséus C. ( 2010 ). DNA barcoding reveals cryptic diversity in Lumbricus terrestris L., 1758 (Clitellata): Resurrection of L. herculeus (Savigny, 1826). PLoS One 5: e15629 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), than in our case. 
 
Specimens from both COI haplogroups co-occur at five localities ( Table 1 ) and in three of these cases, specimens from group 1 and group 2 do share ITS2 haplotypes. This can be an indication that they are part of the same local population, and that the whole Scandinavian metapopulation of A. longa is panmictic, i.e., all individuals reproduce freely with each other. 
 
There are at least three possible explanations for the observed genetic pattern. It can be explained as (1) a case of despeciation (Turner, 2002 Turner GF. ( 2002 ). Parallel speciation, despeciation and respeciation: Implications for species definition. Fish Fish 3: 225 – 9 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), where two separated, divergent lineages after secondary contact start to interbreed to such extent that the species boundaries between them are broken up and they form a single metapopulation. This has been suggested as explanation for sympatric, divergent, interbreeding lineages within bird species (Hogner et al., 2012 Hogner S , Laskemoen T , Lifjeld JT , Porkert J , Kleven O , Albayrak T , Kabasakal B , Johnsen A. ( 2012 ). Deep sympatric mitochondrial divergence without reproductive isolation in the common redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus . Ecol Evol 2: 2974 – 88 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Webb et al., 2011 Webb WC , Marzluff JM , Omland KE. ( 2011 ). Random interbreeding between cryptic lineages of the Common Raven: Evidence for speciation in reverse. Mol Ecol 20: 2390 – 402 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ), and it has also been suggested as an explanation for mt-divergence in some clitellates (De Wit & Erséus, 2010 De Wit P , Erséus C. ( 2010 ). Genetic variation and phylogeny of Scandinavian species of Grania (Annelida: Clitellata: Enchytraeidae), with the discovery of a cryptic species. J Zool Syst Evol Res 48: 285 – 93 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Martinsson et al., 2013 Martinsson S , Achurra A , Svensson M , Erséus C. ( 2013 ). Integrative taxonomy of the freshwater worm Rhyacodrilus falciformis s.l. (Clitellata: Naididae), with the description of a new species. Zool Scripta 42: 612 – 22 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). (2) A second explanation would be introgression, where due to limited hybridization, a part of one population’s genome gets incorporated in another distinct population. Introgression has been shown to explain mt-paraphyly in several animal groups, including, e.g., ducks and chipmunks (Good et al., 2008 Good JM , Hird S , Reid N , Demboski JR , Steppan SJ , Martin-Nims TR , Sullivan J. ( 2008 ). Ancient hybridization and mitochondrial capture between two species of chipmunks. Mol Ecol 17: 1313 – 27 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Peters et al., 2007 Peters JL , Zhuravlev Y , Fefelov I , Logie A , Omland KE. ( 2007 ). Nuclear loci and coalescent methods support ancient hybridization as cause of mitochondrial paraphyly between Gadwall and Falcated Duck ( Anas spp .). Evolution 61: 1992 – 2006 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). In our case, a distinct mitochondrial lineage originated elsewhere could have been introgressed into the Scandinavian population. About 5% of the Scandinavian population of A. longa are from COI haplogroup 1, while the large majority is from haplogroup 2 (CE unpublished data), and it therefore seems reasonable to assume that haplogroup 1 has introgressed into haplogroup 2. Searches in GenBank and BOLD also give much fewer records of haplogroup 1 than of haplogroup 2, and it is not possible to speculate on the origin of this group. According to searches in GenBank and BOLD, group 2 seems to be widespread in Western Europe with records from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, United Kingdom, and France and also introduced to Canada, whereas group 1 is so far found in Scandinavia and Great Britain, and also introduced to Canada. (3) Finally, the great COI divergence in NW European A. longa may be due to ancient mitochondrial polymorphism, where the two haplogroups have arisen and remained within the species, whereas intermediate haplogroups have disappeared due to random genetic drift (Kimura, 1955 Kimura M. ( 1955 ). Random genetic drift in multi-allelic locus. Evolution 9: 419 – 35 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). The Pleistocene glaciations probably caused massive extinction among European earthworms, and the surviving species went through bottlenecks, reducing the genetic variation within them (Amos & Harwood, 1998 Amos W , Harwood J. ( 1998 ). Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations. Philos Trans R Soc Lond, B, Biol Sci 353: 177 – 86 . [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). 
Conclusions 
 
This study again highlights the problems with using DNA-barcoding alone for species discovery and delimitation. If we would have used only COI data and analyzed them with distance methods, it is likely that we would have concluded that A. longa is in fact two species. However, by incorporating additional data and analyses, we found no support for cryptic speciation within this species. Previous studies on clitellates have also questioned the uncritical use of COI alone for species recognition (Achurra & Erséus, 2013 Achurra A , Erséus C. ( 2013 ). DNA barcoding and species delimitation: The Stylodrilus heringianus case (Annelida: Clitellata: Lumbriculidae). Invertebr Syst 27: 118 – 28 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ; Martinsson et al., 2013 Martinsson S , Achurra A , Svensson M , Erséus C. ( 2013 ). Integrative taxonomy of the freshwater worm Rhyacodrilus falciformis s.l. (Clitellata: Naididae), with the description of a new species. Zool Scripta 42: 612 – 22 . [Crossref] , [Web of Science ®] ,   [Google Scholar] ). Nevertheless, it is still important to point out that when a good reference library with well-delimited species exists, DNA-barcoding is a useful tool for specimen identification, not the least with in Clitellata, where cryptic species are common (Erséus & Gustafsson, 2009 Erséus C , Gustafsson D. ( 2009 ). Cryptic speciation in clitellate model organisms . In: Shain DH , editor. Annelids in modern biology. Hoboken, NJ : John Wiley & Sons, Inc . [Crossref] ,   [Google Scholar] ). However, for species delimitation as such, we strongly recommend that mitochondrial markers are always used in combination with other data sources.
