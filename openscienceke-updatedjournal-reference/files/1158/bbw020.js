Modern implementations of these frameworks differ on three key dimensions: using an implicit or explicit syntax, using a configuration, convention or class-based design paradigm and offering a command line or workbench interface. Here I survey and compare the design philosophies of several current pipeline frameworks. I provide practical recommendations based on analysis requirements and the user base.","context":{"all":{"count":13976883,"mean":8.2387155524274,"rank":175442,"pct":98,"higher_than":13801382},"journal":{"count":1097,"mean":6.500947080292,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":1095},"similar_age_3m":{"count":264661,"mean":11.91200824454,"rank":6175,"pct":97,"higher_than":258485},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":62,"mean":4.882131147541,"rank":1,"pct":98,"higher_than":61}},"authors":["Jeremy Leipzig"],"type":"article","handles":[],"altmetric_id":6309789,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":192,"cited_by_tweeters_count":166,"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":2,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":171,"last_updated":1543927797,"score":96.85,"history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":96.85},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbw020","added_on":1458826970,"published_on":1458777600,"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Physical Sciences","Life Sciences","Computer Science"],"readers":{"citeulike":"11","mendeley":"691","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":702,"images":{"small":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=97&types=rtttttwf","medium":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=97&types=rtttttwf","large":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=97&types=rtttttwf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=6309789"})
