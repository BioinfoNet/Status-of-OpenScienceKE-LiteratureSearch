In order to facilitate data exchange and file conversions between population genetics programs, we introduce PGDSpider, a Java program that can read 27 different file formats and export data into 29, partially overlapping, other file formats. The PGDSpider package includes both an intuitive graphical user interface and a command-line version allowing its integration in complex data analysis pipelines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":12023633,"mean":7.5167196189821,"rank":7517841,"pct":23,"higher_than":2796932},"journal":{"count":7976,"mean":6.8462846394984,"rank":6475,"pct":12,"higher_than":1028},"similar_age_3m":{"count":255551,"mean":5.5510200978285,"rank":132303,"pct":33,"higher_than":86053},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":112,"mean":4.9232612612613,"rank":80,"pct":15,"higher_than":17}},"authors":["H.
