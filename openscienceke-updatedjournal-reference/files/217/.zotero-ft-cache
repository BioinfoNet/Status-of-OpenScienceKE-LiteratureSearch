Abstract 
 
The family Curculionidae (Coleoptera), the “true” weevils, have diversified tightly linked to the evolution of flowering plants. Here, we aim to assess diversification at a lower taxonomic level. We analyze the evolution of the genus Trichobaris in association with their host plants. Trichobaris comprises eight to thirteen species; their larvae feed inside the fruits of Datura spp. or inside the stem of wild and cultivated species of Solanaceae, such as potato, tobacco and tomato. We ask the following questions: (1) does the rostrum of Trichobaris species evolve according to the plant tissue used to oviposit, i.e., shorter rostrum to dig in stems and longer to dig in fruits? and (2) does Trichobaris diversify mainly in relation to the use of Datura species? For the first question, we estimated the phylogeny of Trichobaris based on four gene sequences (nuclear 18S and 28S rRNA genes and mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI genes). Then, we carried out morphogeometric analyses of the Trichobaris species using 75 landmarks. For the second question, we calibrated a COI haplotype phylogeny using a constant rate of divergence to infer the diversification time of Trichobaris species, and we traced the host plant species on the haplotype network. We performed an ancestral state reconstruction analysis to infer recent colonization events and conserved associations with host plant species. We found that ancestral species in the Trichobaris phylogeny use the stem of Solanum plants for oviposition and display weak sexual dimorphism of rostrum size, whereas other, more recent species of Trichobaris display sexual dimorphism in rostrum size and use the fruits of Datura species, and a possible reversion to use the stem of Solanaceae was detected in one Trichobaris species. The use of Datura species by Trichobaris species is widely distributed on haplotype networks and restricted to Trichobaris species that originated ca. 5 ± 1.5 Ma. Given that the origin of Trichobaris is estimated to be ca. 6 ± 1.5 Ma, it is likely that Datura has played a role in its diversification.

1. Introduction 
 
It is rare to see the process of speciation in nature. The use of both phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches can help in understanding the evolution of species. Ideally, one should sample all species of a taxonomic group, such as a genus, and test that all named species constitute evolutionary entities within that group to rule out the effects of other processes, as well develop explanations for observed patterns ( Avise and Johns, 1999 , Holt and Jønsson, 2014 ). The phylogenetic hypothesis provides an indirect record of the sequence of lineage-divergence events ( Barraclough and Nee, 2001 ) that can be complemented with phylogeographic analysis. This permits the recognition of the geographic and spatial genetic structure of populations within a species at early stages of differentiation ( Avise, 2000 , Gavrilets, 2003 ). These integrative studies can provide insights into how speciation proceeds (e.g., Chen et al., 2017 , Supple et al., 2014 ). 
 
Speciation in phytophagous insects has long been associated with plant diversification ( Ehrlich and Raven, 1964 , Farrell, 1998 ). The majority of phytophagous species in the order Coleoptera belong to the superfamilies Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea ( Grimaldi and Engel, 2005 ). Curculionidae beetles, known as weevils, include approximately 62 000 described species ( Oberprieler et al., 2007 ). Weevil diversity is associated mainly with angiosperms ( McKenna et al., 2009 ) due to their ability to exploit different plant tissues ( Marvaldi et al., 2002 ). However, weevil diversity has been associated with presumed key innovations, such as the rostrum’s length and shape, endophagous larvae and geniculate antennae and, in some groups, their association with fungi ( Oberprieler et al., 2007 , Matsubayashi et al., 2010 ). 
 
Weevils are pests of many economically important plants, such as chestnut, sugarcane, banana, cotton, raspberry, avocado, mango, pecan, pepper, alfalfa and sunflower ( Avtzis et al., 2013 , Kuroki and Kodama, 1987 , Lemic et al., 2016 , Shankar et al., 2015 , Barr et al., 2013 , Parra et al., 2009 , Castañeda-Vildózola et al., 2015 , Bierig, 1939 , Basio et al., 1994 , Mynhardt, 2006 , Capinera, 2005 , Iwase et al., 2015 , Charlet, 1983 ). The historical relationship between weevils and their host plants has scarcely been explored at the macroevolutionary level. Determination of ancestral and recently colonized host plant species is also a topic that remains understudied (e.g., Iwase et al., 2015 , Kuester et al., 2012 ). Some studies have shown the ecological and evolutionary consequences of host shifts for biological control and to sustain productivity ( Oliveira et al., 2012 ). 
 
At a microevolutionary level, the effect of the host plant species on the genetic variation of weevil species in a genus is, likewise, a poorly explored question (e.g., Hernández-Vera et al., 2010 , Kohyama et al., 2014 ). In some instances, no clear relationship between the genetic variation of weevils and their host plants has been found. In the stenophagous capitulum weevil ( Larinus cynarae ), the primary distribution of its genetic diversity indicates a geographic division followed by branching of L. cynarae ’s lineage into different host plants ( Briese et al., 1996 ). However, in the boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis , three morphological forms associated with species of Gossypium have been described ; although some haplotypes appeared related to either wild or cultivated cotton ( Barr et al., 2013 ), most genetic differentiation is due to their geographical distribution ( Kuester et al., 2012 ). In an extreme case, genetic variation of alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica , is not associated with its host plant or with its geographic distribution ( Iwase et al., 2015 ). However, the interaction between weevils and their host plants can result in a clear association of genetic variation of both organisms, as exemplified by Curculio hilgendorfi and Castanopsis sieboldi ( Aoki et al., 2011 ), or as a shared phylogeographical pattern ( Aoki et al., 2009 ). 
 
Weevil species of the genus Trichobaris (Curculionidae: Baridinae) use plants in the family Solanaceae as food and for larval development inside stems or fruits. The female digs a hole in the stem or fruit to oviposit; hatching larvae feed inside until pupation; and once metamorphosis occurs, adults emerge to start a new life cycle ( Cabrales-Vargas, 1991 ). Twelve described species integrate the genus: Trichobaris major Barber 1935 , T. soror Champion 1909, T. pueblana Casey 1920, T. trinotata Say 1831, T. insolita Casey 1892, T. championi Barber 1935 , T. mucorea LeConte 1854, T. bridwelli Barber 1935 , T. compacta Casey 1892, T. pellicea Boheman 1844, T. texana LeConte 1876 and T. cylindrica Casey 1892. Of these species, six develop into fruits of Datura species, three species into the stems of potato, tobacco and tomatillo ( Solanum tuberosum, Nicotiana attenuata and Physalis spp., respectively), and four into the stems of wild species of Solanum ( S. eleagnifolium, S. rostratum, S. carolinense ) ( Barber, 1935 ). The life cycle of these weevils is closely associated with their host plants; for instance, the larvae of T. bridwelli cannot survive in a different host ( Cuda and Burke, 1991 ). Ever since Barber’s (1935) monographic study, the genus has not been studied again in such depth. His work on Trichobaris includes specimens from a wide range of locations and detailed morphological descriptions. Nevertheless, Barber (1935) noted issues not resolved as of yet, including the need for precise information on host plants and the relevance of body shape and size in delimiting morphological species because some named species were thought to be environmentally related variants. Thus, the study of speciation makes it necessary to identify and establish the species, their host plants and the determination of their evolutionary relationships. 
 
In this study, we follow two approximations to study the evolution of Trichobaris species with their host plants. Under a phylogenetic framework, we tested whether the rostrum of Trichobaris species evolved according to the plant tissue used to oviposit, i.e., short rostrum for dig the stem in ancestral species of Trichobaris and long rostrum for dig the fruit in derived species of Trichobaris . We analyze the general morphology and, in particular, the rostrum of this weevils and build a molecular phylogeny using four gene sequences. We also tested whether diversification of Trichobaris is due mainly to the use of Datura species. To do this, under a phylogeographic framework, we map the host distribution on the haplotype network of each Trichobaris species and reconstructed the ancestral host plant species on the calibrated COI haplotype phylogeny to infer the historical associations or new colonizations of host plants. 
2. Material and methods 
2.1. Sampling and specimens examined 
 
A total of 168 insects (including adult and larval stages) were collected in 33 localities across the Trichobaris distribution range in Mexico and the United States of America (USA) ( Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). All adult insects were identified using the key provided by Barber (1935) . We collected almost all described species of Trichobaris Le Conte ( Barber, 1935 ). Collectively, we found weevils in eight different species of Datura , four wild species of Solanaceae ( Physallis sp., Solanum eleagnifolium, S. carolinense and S. rostratum ) and one cultivated species of Solanaceae (potato, S. tuberosum ).

We do not use all collected specimens of Trichobaris for the analysis because immature stages cannot be used to identify species. Larvae were used only if adults were not found in some localities. Due to their small size, non-destructive DNA extraction was not possible. Then, we randomly selected subsets of insects for morphology and genetic analysis. We used 139 insects for morphological analysis ( Table 1 ), 156 insects for phylogenetic analysis (documenting geographical distribution and plant host), and 189 COI sequences generated in this study for phylogeographic analyses. In addition, we included the sequences obtained from two previous studies ( T. soror , De-la-Mora et al., 2015 ; and T. compacta , De-la-Mora et al., in revision), resulting in a total of 844 COI sequences that comprise 198 COI haplotypes used to build a calibrated phylogeny and reconstruct the ancestral host plant. 
2.2. Geometric morphometrics 
 
A total of 139 insects were identified ( Barber, 1935 ) and photographed from frontal (rostrum), lateral (body shape) and dorsal (pronotum) views. We oriented the images identically: the frontal (with the head at the middle of the photograph), the lateral always was the left side (with the mesopleuron placed in the middle) and the dorsal view, with the scutellum oriented towards the bottom and the head towards the top). We use two different imaging methods: a SteREO Discovery V8 Zeiss stereomicroscope combined with AxioVision software for image processing (Instituto de Ecología, UNAM) and a Canon EOS 6D camera mounted on StackShot automated macro rail ® Cognisys Inc., combined with Helicon Focus image processing software (Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University). 
 
Landmark analysis – We assessed three images per specimen for a total of 79 landmarks: 8 frontal, 39 lateral and 28 dorsal ( Fig. 2 ). These were quantified from a set of two-dimensional coordinates with tpsDIG 1.4 software ( Rohlf, 2004 ). To remove differences due to scale, orientation and location from landmark configurations, we used a minimum Procrustes distance criterion, implemented in MorphoJ ( Klingenberg, 2011 ), to produce a set of partial Procrustes superimpositions of the specimens. The coordinates obtained were transformed into relative warp scores to generate a W matrix. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), we analyzed shape variation among morphotypes. To maximize individual differences according to species, we performed a canonical variate analysis followed by a discriminant analysis among pairs of species. Both analyses were implemented in MorphoJ ( Klingenberg, 2011 ). Centroid size for frontal (rostrum), lateral (body shape) and dorsal (pronotum) views were plotted using R (R Development Core Team 2011).

2.3. DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing 
 
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole insects using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen). Four gene sequences were used to build the Trichobaris phylogeny: two mitochondrial genes (CO1 and 16S rRNA) and two nuclear genes (18S and 28S rRNA). The primers used were COA3107 and COS2183N ( Sota et al., 2004 ), LR-J-12887F and LR-N-13398R ( Simon et al., 1994 ), 28S and 28SR, and Insect18S-midF and Insect18S-midR (from Kobayashi et al., 2012 ) for the COI, 16S, 28S and 18S genes, respectively. All PCR reactions were performed in volumes of 19.8 μL: 2 μL of 10x buffer, 1 µL of 20x MgCl 2 , 0.8 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 µL of 10 mM forward primer, 1 µL of 10 mM reverse primer, 1 µL of Taq Amplificasa®, 1 µL of 50 mM DNA and 12 µL of H 2 O. The amplification conditions were the same for all gene sequences except for 16S rRNA, whose annealing temperature was 50 °C ( Sota et al., 2004 ). An initial period of 5 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1.2 min at 55 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C. Samples were sequenced at the University of Washington’s High-Throughput Genomics Center (ABI 3730XL sequencer and the ABI Prism kit Cycle Sequencing Big Dye Terminator Ready Reaction; Applied Biosystems). 
 
Sequence processing was performed with Sequencher® 5.0 software (Gene Codes Corporation). The alignment was carried out by the FFT-NS-1 progressive alignment method, using the online version of the software MAFFT v7 ( http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/ ). 
2.4. Estimation of genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis 
 
The amount of genetic variability of COI, 16S, 18S and 28S sequences was estimated with the software DNAsp ver. 5.1 ( Rozas et al., 2003 ). The total number of haplotypes, mutations, segregating sites ( S ), nucleotide diversity ( π ), haplotype diversity ( h ) and theta ( θ ) using Nei’s (1987) equations were estimated for the mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (18S and 28S) sequences. 
 
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for each locus separately, as well as for the concatenated matrix. Sitophilus oryzae (Curculionidae) was specified as the outgroup. Different codon positions were treated as separate partitions only for the COI sequence. Phylogenies were estimated using Bayesian Inference with the BEAST2 software. v2.4.5. ( Bouckaert et al., 2014 ). The analysis was executed using 100,000,000 MCMC, 10,000 “burn in” with the GTR + I molecular replacement model using a fixed substitution rate of 1 substitution/site/unit time. The MCMC convergence of the chains was evaluated considering the effective sample size scores, all above 100, using Tracer v. 1.6 ( Rambaut et al., 2014 ), and the trees were summarized with TreeAnnotator v2.1.2 ( Rambaut and Drummond, 2014 ). Finally, the phylogenetic tree was visualized in FigTree v 1.4 ( Rambaut, 2012 ). 
2.5. Ancestral plant tissue and rostrum evolution 
 
Second and third phylogenies were built using just one sequence per species (including the four markers), randomly chosen from the previous phylogenetic clustering (defined in geometric morphometric analysis). For the reconstruction of the ancestral plant tissue used by Trichobaris , all species were included, except for the phylogeny built for rostrum evolution, where only species with geometric morphometric information available for the rostrum of both males and females were used. Both phylogenies were estimated using Bayesian Inference with the BEAST2 software v2.4.5. ( Bouckaert et al., 2014 ). The analysis was executed using 100 000 000 MCMC, 10 000 “burn in” with the GTR + I molecular replacement model using a fixed substitution rate of 1 substitution/site/unit time. Here, the MCMC convergence of the chains was also evaluated considering the effective sample size scores (ESS), all above 100, using Tracer v. 1.6 ( Rambaut et al., 2014 ), and the trees were summarized with TreeAnnotator v2.1.2 ( Rambaut and Drummond, 2014 ). 
 
To reconstruct the ancestral plant tissue and the evolution of rostrum of Trichobaris , we reconstructed ancestral states with maximum likelihood using the “phytools” package ( Revell, 2012 ), implemented in R (R Development Core Team 2011). The plant tissue was coded as a discrete characteristic (F = fruit, S = stem and U = for uncertainty of the tissue for the outgroup). We used the ER model (equal rates) that assumes the same probability for rate index matrix and the ARD model (all rates different) that assumes the different probability. A likelihood ratio test (LRT) was conducted to test for the best fit of the two models to the data. For the rostrum evolution, we use the mean centroid size per species, per sex, and coded it as a continuous characteristic. Here, we apply a Brownian motion model for the evolution of the rostrum. The phylogenetic signal of the rostrum per sex was estimated using the K -statistic ( Blomberg et al., 2003 ) and λ ( Pagel, 1999 ), both with nsim = 1 000 in “phytools” ( Revell, 2012 ). 
2.6. COI haplotype network and host plant 
 
Using the gene variation at the COI gene sequence from two previous studies ( De-la-Mora et al., 2015 and De-la-Mora et al., submitted) and the ones obtained in this study, we compared the measures of genetic diversity within and between species with the DNAsp software ( Rozas et al., 2003 ). The relationship between haplotypes and their host-plant distribution was explored with haplotype networks built in Network ver. 4.6.1.1 software ( Bandelt et al., 1999 ) through a median-joining algorithm. 
2.7. COI haplotype phylogeny 
 
Using the COI haplotypes of all Trichobaris species, we built the haplotype tree with Bayesian Inference using BEAST software. ver. 1.4.7 ( Drummond and Rambaut, 2007 ). The analysis was executed using 10,000,000 MCMC, 1000 “burn in” with the GTR + I molecular replacement model. The phylogeny was calibrated with a 2% divergence per million years, previously reported for COI in coleopterans ( Nakamine and Takeda, 2008 ). The MCMC convergence of the chains was evaluated considering the effective sample size scores (ESS), all above 100, using Tracer v. 1.6 ( Rambaut et al., 2014 ), and the trees were summarized with TreeAnnotator v2.1.2 ( Rambaut and Drummond, 2014 ). The phylogenetic tree was visualized in FigTree v 1.4 ( Rambaut, 2012 ). 
2.8. Ancestral host plant reconstruction analysis 
 
The gene CO1 has been effective in recognizing insect haplotypes associated with host plants ( Jurado-Rivera et al., 2009 ). Here, we used the phylogenetic tree built from COI haplotypes instead of the species phylogeny because the former has greater resolution, allowing for comparison of terminals to host plants. We coded ambiguous haplotypes (present in two or more host plants) present only in the most abundant host plant. Ancestral host utilization was estimated with maximum likelihood using the “phytools” package ( Revell, 2012 ) implemented in R (R Development Core Team 2011). The eleven host plants occupied by Trichobaris species were considered a discrete character. The host plant of the outgroup species was required for the analysis, although this is an arbitrary assignment. We used a continuous-time Markov chain model (Mk model) ( Suchard et al., 2001 ) for trait evolution, assuming all transitions in the character state with the same probability. We did not attempt to estimate the phylogenetic signal for discrete characters (some methods exist but for binary characters; see Fritz and Purvis, 2010 ). For ancestral host plant reconstruction, the geographic distribution of species using different hosts was also taken into account through the phylogeny of haplotypes. Different models of reconstruction were not tested because there is no empirical evidence or theoretical basis to suppose differential transition rates between states (host plants); for instance, some species of insects would follow secondary chemical compounds present in one species of plant and not in other. Additionally, it is methodologically complex to analyze 12 discrete states because of the large number of parameters involved. 
3. Results 
3.1. Species and geometric morphometric analysis 
 
From sampled insects and according to Barber’s descriptions, we identified T. soror, T. major, T. compacta, T. mucorea, T. mucorea var. striatula Casey 1920 , T. texana, T. cylindrica and T. trinotata. A total of nine Trichobaris species were included in the geometric morphometric analysis, with eight species being distinguishable: T. soror, T. major, T. mucorea, T. mucorea var . striatula, T. texana, T. cylindrica, T. trinotata and T. compacta ( Fig. 3 ) . Missing from Barber’s descriptions were T. pueblana, T. compacta var. retrusa and T. bridwelli . We found sexual dimorphism in the rostrum; T. soror, T. major and T. trinotata have females with longer and thinner rostrums among the other females of Trichobaris species ( Fig. 4 ). Here, T. insolita and T. cylindrica are not shown due to sample size (<2); Figs. 5 and 1S Supplementary Material).

3.2. Estimation of genetic variability and phylogenetic relationships 
 
We sequenced 663 bp of COI, 454 bp of 16S, 429 bp of 18S and 771 bp of 28S from 156 randomly selected insects. There was substantial variation in resolution among the four gene regions. For COI, we found 59 haplotypes, with h  = 0.874, π  = 0.052, θ  = 0.064 and S  = 26. For 16S, 26 haplotypes were found, with h  = 0.762, π = 0.025, θ  = 0.06 and S  = 6. For the nuclear sequences 18S and 28S, we found 15 ( h  = 0.593, π  = 0.005, θ  = 0.020 and S  = 3) and 18 ( h  = 0.518, π  = 0.025, θ  = 0.062 and S  = 10) consensus sequences, respectively. GenBank accession numbers: KY984501-KY984658 for 28S, KY984659-KY984816 for 18S, KY984817-KY984974 for 16S and KX359724-KX359774 for COI. 
 
The Bayesian phylogeny provides an estimate of the evolutionary relationships among Trichobaris species ( Fig. 6 ; for posterior probability of parameters and tracer, see Fig. S2 Supplementary Material). Six species agree with the morphological groupings and species reported. Trichobaris major and T. soror belong to the same morphological group and are genetically indistinguishable. Because larvae were used for this analysis, identification of some species required further confirmation, namely, T. pellicea , which was identified on the basis of its distribution and host plant. In general, the phylogenetic tree shows high posterior probability support for eight Trichobaris species.

3.3. Host plant tissue and weevil’s rostrum evolution 
 
We reconstructed the host plant tissue used by weevils on the phylogeny of Trichobaris ( Fig. 6 ; for posterior probability of parameters and tracer see Fig. S3 Supplementary Material). Two clades use different plant tissues to oviposit: Clade 1 ( T. cylindrica and T. texana) uses the stem, while clade 2 ( T. pellicea, T. mucorea var. striatula, T. compacta, T. mucorea, T. soror and T. trinotata ) uses the fruit, except T. trinotata . Models ER and ARD for the rate of transitions (LRT = 4.20: critical value = 11.7 for p  = 0.05) were not significantly different. Rostrum varies from 1.32 to 2.24 mm for females and from 1.33 to 1.66 for males ( Fig. 7 ; for posterior probability of parameters and tracer see Fig. S4 Supplementary Material). The phylogenetic signal for this trait was low in both sexes (females: K -statistic = 0.1382412, p -value = 0.373; λ = 6.843901e-05, p -value = 1; males: K -statistic = 0.2773729, p- value = 0.477; λ = 6.843901e-05, p- value = 1).

The haplotype network of T. mucorea (n = 67) shows 16 haplotypes (Fig. 6S Supplementary Material), most of them distributed only on D. stramonium, three on D. inoxia and one on three host plants: D. pruinosa, D. discolor and D. stramonium (Fig. S6 Supplementary Material). The haplotype network of T. soror (n = 469) shows 99 haplotypes, mostly on D. stramonium, but nine haplotypes are also found on D. quercifolia. The low-frequency haplotypes So92, So93 and So94 were found on D. inoxia, D. pruinosa and Solanum carolinense (Fig. S7 Supplementary Material). The haplotype network of T. trinotata (n = 21) shows four haplotypes with a shared distribution on S. carolinense, S. tuberosum and D. stramonium (Fig. S8 Supplementary Material). The haplotype network of T. compacta (n = 232) shows 49 haplotypes, most of which were sampled on D. wrightii. Five haplotypes are distributed on D. reburra , eight on D. discolor , two on D. pruinosa and two in D. inoxia (Fig. S9 Supplementary Material). 
 
The haplotype network of T. mucorea var. striatula (n = 23) shows 13 haplotypes mainly distributed on D. wrightii and four haplotypes on D. discolor (Fig. S10 Supplementary Material). The haplotype network of T. texana (n = 7) shows three haplotypes distributed on S. rostratum (Fig. S11 Supplementary Material). The haplotype network of T. cylindrica (n = 4) shows three haplotypes distributed on S. eleagnifolium (Fig. S11 Supplementary Material) . Finally, T. pellicea n = 3 shows two haplotypes distributed on D. stramonium (Fig. S11 Supplementary Material). 
3.5. Haplotype calibrated phylogeny 
 
Most clades that were inferred with high support based on the four loci ( Fig. 6 ) were also inferred and strongly supported by the COI haplotype phylogeny ( Fig. 9 ; for posterior probability of parameters and tracer see Fig. S5 Supplementary Material), except for T. pellicea , which appears in a different position. The time-calibrated haplotype phylogeny shows that most Trichobaris species are no older than 6.6 (±1.5) million years ago (Ma). Diversification of T. soror, T. trinotata, T. mucorea, T. compacta and T. mucorea var. striatula haplotypes is very recent (less than 0.5 Ma) ( Fig. 9 ).

3.6. Estimation of ancestral host plant species 
 
We estimated the ancestral host plant based on the COI haplotype phylogeny of Trichobaris species ( Fig. 9 ). Here, we indicated the ancestral host at eleven nodes from (0–10), whose estimated likelihood values were not conclusive for nodes 0, 1, 2 and 4. Node 3 suggests with a 0.528 likelihood that S. eleagnifolium could be the ancestral host plant of T. texana and T. cylindrica . Likelihood values of 0.318 and 0.982 from nodes 5 and 7, respectively, support the hypothesis that D. wrightii was the ancestral host plant of T. compacta and T. mucorea var . striatula . Finally, nodes 6, 8, 9 and 10 suggest that D. stramonium was the ancestral host plant of T. soror, T. trinotata and T. mucorea (0.272, 0.784, 0.862 and 0.983, respectively, at each node). 
4. Discussion 
 
This study constitutes the first integrative analysis, using morphological, phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches, of Trichobaris species to investigate their association with Solanaceae plants. Our results provide relevant insights to understand the evolution of Trichobaris and its relationships with host plants. 
4.1. Trichobaris species and Barber’s key 
 
Barber’s monographic account of Trichobaris ( Barber, 1935 ) recognizes female rostrum length, body shape and male genitalia as critical morphological characters to distinguish Trichobaris species. In Barber’s key, the female rostrum allows us to distinguish T. soror, T. pueblana and T. major from all other Trichobaris species. In our study, we found that male and female rostrum shape is an important character across Trichobaris species. The rostrum has been identified as a key innovation in the evolution of weevils ( Oberprieler et al., 2007 ), and even at a lower taxonomic level, the rostrum is an important trait in the evolution of this genus ( Fig. 7 ). 
 
Evidence indicates that T. soror, T. major, T. trinotata, T. compacta, T. texana and T. cylindrica differ in body shape from each other ( Fig. 3 ). In species such as T. insolita and T. championi , the clustering of individuals had no statistical significance, although this might be a consequence of small sample sizes. 
 
We found that T. soror and T. major are morphologically distinguishable ( Fig. 6 ), although they do not show differences in COI haplotypes ( Fig. 3 ). In contrast, T. mucorea and T. mucorea var . striatula show close morphological clustering ( Fig. 3 ), but they are genetically very distant, similar to cryptic species; in fact, T. mucorea is closely related to T. soror , whereas T. mucorea var . striatula is closer to T. compacta ( Fig. 3 ). 
 
Barber’s species of Trichobaris not included in our phylogeny were T. pueblana, T. championi, T. bridwelli and T. insolita. Although we sampled several populations in the state of Puebla and in the reported host plant (D. stramonium), we did not find T. pueblana . Trichobaris championi is a crop pest of tomatillo ( Physalis ixocarpa ) in Mexico ( Calyecac-Cortero et al., 2004 ). Instead, the weevils collected in wild Physalis species belonged to T. mucorea, which has also been reported in the stems of Nicotiana attenuata ( Diezel et al., 2011 ). Trichobaris bridwelli was reported by Barber as the single weevil species that feeds upon the fruits of D. stramonium in the USA ( Barber, 1935 ); however, the species of Trichobaris that we collected on D. stramonium was T. soror (see below). Finally, a single T. insolita was reported from a single locality in Florida (USA) on a patch of plants of Physalis sp . ( Barber, 1935 ). We were not able to corroborate that finding. 
4.2. Phylogenetic patterns and rostrum evolution 
 
In Curculio species ( Toju and Sota, 2009 , Davis, 2014 ), an evolutionary trend to increase rostrum length in specialized relationships with their host plants to drill the fruits and oviposit has been documented (e.g., Toju, 2009 ). In Trichobaris , we observed a tendency to increase rostrum size among weevil species that use fruits, instead of stems, to oviposit ( Fig. 6 ) in comparison with the ancestral clade ( T. texana and T. cylindrica ); however, this remains speculative at the moment. When the phylogenetic signal is high, closely related species exhibit similar traits, and this biological similarity decreases as the evolutionary distance between species increases. In our study, rostrum size had a low phylogenetic signal, perhaps due to the bias induced by small branches near the tips (e.g., T. trinotata and T. soror ). 
4.3. Phylogeographic patterns and host plant associations 
 
Although our sampling of Trichobaris did not cover all the geographic distribution regions reported for the species in the USA’s midwest ( T. texana, T. bridwelli and T. trinotata; Barber, 1935 , Cuda and Burke, 1984 ), we report the host plant of these species. We found that the insects collected on D. stramonium in the USA (locality 1VA, Fig. 1 and Table 1 ) vary only in 2 or 3 mutational steps in the haplotype network of T. soror (haplotypes: So93, So94, So95 and So96; Fig. S7 Supplementary Material). Additionally, T. bridwelli is reported as the only weevil species associated with D. stramonium in the USA ( Barber, 1935 ). Thus, this suggests that T. soror is also distributed up to the western USA. The reported potato pest, T. trinotata, is associated with S. tuberosum and S. carolinense ( Cuda and Burke, 1986 , Wise, 2007 ), and our study supports these observations (Fig. S8 Supplementary Material). 
 
Mapping the host plant onto the haplotype network and the ancestral host estimation using the phylogeny reveal several relevant aspects ( Fig. 8 , Fig. 9 ). First, the use of Solanum plants by Trichobaris weevils could be older than the occupation of Datura , except for S. carolinense and S. tuberosum , whose estimated ancestral host is D. stramonium . Second, the use of different species of Datura by T. compacta may be more recent than its interaction with D. wrightii . Almost all beetles collected in D. stramonium were T. soror , which also uses D. quercifolia. T. mucorea is associated with D. stramonium , and T. mucorea var . striatula is associated with D. wrightii but has a clade within D. discolor . Inconclusive cases, possibly due to sample size, are T. trinotata, T. texana, T. cylindrica and T. pellicea . This means that historical associations and recent colonizations are both critical in explaining the relationship of Trichobaris with its host plants. 
 
A possible directionality on the evolution of resource use in weevils has been proposed ( Malvardi et al., 2002 ). For Trichobaris species, we found that the use of stems and fruits is bidirectional. In the case of T. trinotata , we found that this species develops in the stems of both S. carolinense and S. tuberosum . It is likely that its ancestor developed in Datura fruits ( Fig. 6 ). It has been suggested that host shifts in closely related insect species are more correlated with host plant defensive secondary chemistry than with plant phylogeny ( Futuyma and Agrawal, 2009 : Becerra, 2015 ). In the case of T. soror , it is known that there is spatial variation in the levels of infestation of D. stramonium ( Borbolla, 2015 ), likely associated with alkaloid production, namely, atropine and scopolamine ( Miranda-Pérez et al., 2016 ). Future studies are needed to investigate the role of secondary compound chemistry in the association of Trichobaris with its plant hosts. 
5. Conclusions 
 
Here, we present the phylogenetic relationships among Trichobaris species based on four gene sequences. Additionally, we used a geometric morphometric approach for Trichobaris species to assess their concordance with phylogenetic clades and to test the hypothesis that T. texana and T. cylindrica have weak sexual dimorphism in rostrum size and use the stem of Solanaceae, probably since the origin of the genus (6 ± 1.5 Ma), whereas other, more recent, species of Trichobaris display sexual dimorphism in rostrum size ( T. soror and T. trinotata , mainly) and use the fruits of Datura species (with only one possible reversion: T. trinotata , to the stem of Solanum ). 
 
Trichobaris soror and T. major belong to different morphological groups but to the same clade in the phylogeny, suggesting a recent divergence (less than 1 Ma). In contrast, T. mucorea and T. mucorea var. striatula are morphologically close but belong to different clades in the phylogeny, suggesting that they constitute different species. The latter warrants a formal description. 
 
The haplotype network and the calibrated phylogeny built with the COI gene sequence suggest that most species of Trichobaris have originated recently in interaction with their host plants. Thus, our results indicate that Trichobaris species diverged very recently (less than 5 Ma), mainly associated with Solanum and Datura species, and that such interactions perhaps spurred the evolution of the rostrum to oviposit in different tissues.
