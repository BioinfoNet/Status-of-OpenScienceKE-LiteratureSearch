Abstract

Abstract: The paper proposes a business model analysis framework to identify the main issues that need to be addressed within the context of a specific developing country for the sustainable development and growth of OSS. Based on the longitudinal case study of the Ministry of Health in Kenya, the paper analyses how the adoption and usage of technology has influenced the structures of its health management information systems and the related implications for the health service delivery. The analysis focus onto the human-mediated interplay between the intrinsic material features of the IT artefact and the main elements of the surrounding institutional and technological environment and their influence in relation to the donor-driven reforms of the health sector. Empirical results are then used to critically discuss the main implications of the institutional and technological environment characterizing Government IT innovations in developing countries such as Kenya for the development of local OSS sustainable products. Finally, the main factors identified are then used to build an OSS business model analysis framework. The framework can be used to better understand the major issues that need to be addressed at different institutional levels for the sustainability of OSS in the Governments of developing countries.
