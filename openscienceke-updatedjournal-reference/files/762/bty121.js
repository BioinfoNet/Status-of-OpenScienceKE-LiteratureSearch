The G-INS-1 option of MAFFT was recently reported to have higher accuracy than other methods for large data, but this method has been impractical for most largescale analyses, due to the requirement of large computational resources. We introduce a scalable variant, G-large-INS-1, that has equivalent accuracy to G-INS-1 and is applicable to 50,000 or more sequences.\nThis feature is available in MAFFT versions 7.355 or later at https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/mpi.html.\nkatoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp.\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","context":{"all":{"count":12422152,"mean":7.7072766940161,"rank":2669293,"pct":78,"higher_than":9744099},"journal":{"count":8233,"mean":6.7957852283771,"rank":2892,"pct":64,"higher_than":5333},"similar_age_3m":{"count":274790,"mean":14.088184876396,"rank":75302,"pct":72,"higher_than":199052},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":193,"mean":6.7403958333333,"rank":72,"pct":62,"higher_than":121}},"authors":["Tsukasa Nakamura","Kazunori D Yamada","Kentaro Tomii","Kazutaka Katoh"],"type":"article","handles":[],"altmetric_id":33921660,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":9,"cited_by_tweeters_count":9,"cited_by_accounts_count":9,"last_updated":1520513490,"score":5.7,"history":{"1y":5.7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.7},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty121","added_on":1520182452,"published_on":1519862400,"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Mathematics"],"readers":{"citeulike":"0","mendeley":"45","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":45,"images":{"small":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=6&types=tttttttt","medium":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=6&types=tttttttt","large":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=6&types=tttttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=33921660"})
