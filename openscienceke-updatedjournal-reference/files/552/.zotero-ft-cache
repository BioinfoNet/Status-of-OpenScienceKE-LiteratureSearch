Mechanisms to avail Open Government Data (OGD) have faced challenges because of weak or non-existent statistical systems in most developing countries. Key contributors to the weaknesses include lack of technical capacity to curate and upload national statistics through ICT tools and platforms. This paper seeks to inform on the mechanisms for unlocking OGD through an inter-institutional framework of collaboration between public and private entities. The framework involves resources from KNBS, Strathmore University-@iLabAfrica and the World Bank working in an integrated approach to enhance KNBS data dissemination and information sharing capabilities in line with article 35 of the Constitution of Kenya, Statistics Act No. 4 2006 and the new Information Act of 2016. Keywords: Open Data, Open Government Data (OGD), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Public- Private Partnerships

1. Introduction The term Open Government Data (OGD) can be divided into two different but complementary words, that is, Government Data and Open Data. Open data is a powerful innovative concept that seeks to make data open, accessible and searchable [1], [2]. Completeness, Reusability and Timeliness of this data are among key open data principles [3]. Common sources of open data include social media, companies, NGOs, and governments. Open Knowledge Foundation defines Open Government Data as data produced or commissioned by government or government controlled entities [4]. Such data is made freely available through online platforms that are easy to access 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The World Bank notes that the most widely used open data comes from government and government-supported institutions [5]. Making the data open is only valuable if people use this data to provide sustainable solutions to key problems in a country. In other words, the goal of Open Data is not to benefit the people who hold the data, but to set it free in a way that can benefit the public in important ways [6]. Data has become a key resource for social and commercial activities in this everevolving digital age [3]. In addition to promoting transparency and increasing citizen Copyright © 2017 The authors

participation, OGD has the potential to release social and economic value through the creation of innovative business and services. Consequently, it leads to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goal 16, which advocates for the building of effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels [9]. However, the World Bank notes that the potential of Government data use by the private sector has not yet been met in many countries [5]. More needs to be done to unlock government data that can help launch new businesses, optimize existing companies’ operations, create jobs, and improve the climate for foreign investment. In July 2011, Kenya became the first sub-Saharan country to launch an Open Data government site - opendata.go.ke - an initiative dubbed the Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI), enabling its citizens to gain access to vital information. KODI has achieved major milestones albeit with challenges. Some of the challenges of KODI include lack of a strong mechanism for availing data for uploading on opendata.go.ke portal as well as low skill level among the staff of the participating agencies in curation and presentation of data. In September 2011, Kenya signed its commitment to the Open Government Partnership (OGP) [7]. In an OGP Africa Regional Meeting held on May 2016, it was observed that most countries in Africa, including Kenya, are struggling to honour their commitments. Capacity challenges were among the key issues raised. A study done by data for development experts shows 77 of the world’s low-income countries lack strong government systems, particularly statistical systems capable of supporting and measuring SDGs [10]. A strong statistical system allows for the provision of high-quality data for monitoring and evaluation of development goals [11]. It is for this reason that donors have been encouraged to channel more funds towards statistics to support developing countries efforts to open more government data. As the world embarks on an ambitious project to meet new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is an urgent need to mobilise the data revolution for all people and the whole planet in order to monitor progress, hold governments accountable and foster sustainable development [11]. Addressing the statistical capacity challenges will be a major milestone towards informing the public and policy makers for better planning, policymaking and citizenry participation in development. Recently, Kenya became the 19th African country to pass a law that obliges all public entities to disclose information upon public request. Kenyans will be able to ask for information from public organizations about their activities, employees and their salary scales, among other details. The Access to Information Act of 2016 was signed into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta on 31st August 2016, enabling the public to put all public and private entities to task to explain their actions, policies or decisions upon request [13]. It is therefore prudent to build capacity in government, specifically government agencies that are collaborating in open data initiatives. One of such agencies is the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). KNBS is the principal agency of the Government for collecting, analysing and disseminating statistical data in Kenya. It is the legal custodian of official statistical information in Kenya. Publication and dissemination of official statistical information is one of the core mandates of the Bureau as per the Statistics Act of 2006 [8]. Wide and easy access and usability to official statistical data is a standing priority of KNBS as well as the commitment to quality improvement of the services provided [17]. Therefore, strengthening Bureau’s capacity in data dissemination would go a long way in helping it to achieve its mandate as well as enhance its participation in OGD initiatives. Over the years, the Bureau has faced challenges in disseminating statistical information more efficiently through Information Communication Technology (ICT) tools. A notable challenge is the lack of internal technical capacity to curate and update statistics using ICT tools and platforms. The need to expand the Bureau’s staff skills base and expertise is Copyright © 2017 The authors

evident in its Strategic Plan (2013-2017) that highlights human capacity building as one of its key strategic focus areas [18]. In October 2014, Strathmore University, through @iLabAfrica Research Centre, signed a collaboration agreement with the World Bank and KNBS to carry out a data visualisation project to enhance dissemination of County-level statistics by KNBS through Web and Mobile phone-based dissemination tools. In this first phase, datasets from key publications have been visualised and hosted on an online portal dubbed ‘KNBS County Data Visualisation Portal’, accessible via www.knbs.or.ke/visualizations. The application visualizes several county and national statistics categorized sector wise: Agriculture, Education, Health, Public Finance, and Population. The success of Phase One of the project led to the commissioning of Strathmore University by the World Bank and the Bureau to begin Phase Two. The achievements of Phase One has shown that organisations such as Universities are ideally placed to help explore official public data in meaningful, interesting and interactive ways. It is evident that Public-Private Partnerships can assist governments to open more data to the public. Phase Two commenced in August 2016 and is scheduled to conclude by July 2018. Strathmore University, through @iLabAfrica, is committed to provide technical support to the Bureau to unlock more datasets to Kenyan citizens and the international community through Mobile and Web Applications, to support the sustainable development agenda of Kenya Vision 2030 and provide accurate indicators for monitoring of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper seeks to inform on the role of public-private partnerships to unlock open government data for monitoring and evaluation of national development goals and support to the SDGs progress monitoring. In this paper, a study of the KNBS County Data Dissemination Project takes the foreground.

2. Objectives The KNBS County Data Dissemination Project’s overall objective is to increase public access to county data by enabling KNBS and by extension County Governments to disseminate county datasets that are user friendly, understandable, accurate, timely, detailed and comparable so as to; i.) Strengthen KNBS’s ability to curate and upload more county statistics and select national statistics on an online platform; ii.) Increase public access to county statistics through Web and Mobile-phone based county data dissemination tools and platforms; iii.) Improve transparency and foster accountability within county and national governments through opening up of vital statistics that can be used as key performance indicators at both county and national levels; iv.) Contribute to the Open Data agenda to support and monitor the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

3. Methodology This paper employs a case study research approach. The concept of unlocking open government data for Sustainable Development Goals is discussed in relation to a project that Strathmore University and KNBS have been working on, with funding from the World Bank. The project began with a comprehensive review of existing open data initiatives in Kenya and globally. The goal was to identify the root cause of the gap between government data producers/custodians and data consumers despite the promise of existing initiatives. The results of a research conducted by Strathmore University-@iLabAfrica showed that Copyright © 2017 The authors

lack of technical capacity in government agencies is a key contributor to the agencies’ inability to curate and upload national statistics using ICT tools and platforms. Because of this, they are not able to effectively and efficiently participate in open data initiates. One of such agencies is KNBS, the legal custodian of all statistics in Kenya. A review of challenges reported by similar open data projects in the Bureau funded by various donors indicated that the lack of technical capacity in KNBS contributed to the slow uptake of ICT solutions resultant of the initiatives and hindered project continuity. Additionally, it was noted that there has been strong demand for county-based statistics with the onset of the 2010 constitution that transformed Kenya into a devolved system of government made up of 47 County Governments. Strathmore University therefore sought out to address this gap. Strathmore University-@iLabAfrica drafted and submitted a Concept Note to the World Bank on the formation of an inter-institutional framework to strengthen KNBS County Data Dissemination Capabilities through Research and Attachment Programme. The plan was to have Strathmore University Students and Faculty Research Team work with the KNBS Data Dissemination Team to infuse the much needed technical skills and innovativeness in availing more government data, and most importantly county datasets, onto an open online platform. On successful evaluation of the Concept Note by the World Bank, Strathmore University was contracted to begin Phase One of the project late October 2014. An MoU between Strathmore University and KNBS was also signed. To kick start the project, two committees were formed; the Steering and Inter-disciplinary Committees. The Steering Committee’s key roles and responsibilities were Strategic Guidance, Definition of Project Guidelines, and Setting of Project Priorities. Its members comprised of representatives from the three implementing entities that is KNBS, Strathmore University and The World Bank. Members of the Inter-disciplinary committee consisted of sector specific experts (Economists, Statisticians, Information Technology Specialists and Governance Experts) from Strathmore University. The Inter-disciplinary committee’s key roles were to provide specialized project consultation, participate in research related to the project, and help steer the project to completion. The lessons learnt from the KNBS project have informed the ideas discussed in this paper to a great extent. The project implementation details are relevant and applicable to OGD initiatives that seek to unlock more development data for monitoring and evaluation purposes.

4. Technology Description The role of technology in building successful OGD portals is undeniable. Over the years, governments have embraced the importance of technology and innovation in service delivery. A key area is in providing citizens with open access to vital data and information that was previously locked up in file cabinets, unreachable databases and publications. Kenya has made noteworthy achievements as the first sub-Saharan country to launch an Open Data government site albeit with challenges. Unlocking OGD involves the transformation of data into machine-readable format [2] that is, a format that can be automatically read and processed by a computer [15]. These formats allow easy analysis and visualisation of the data using data analytics software tools such as Tableau, Qlik, Microsoft R among others. These tools transform data into various graphical formats and visuals that are easy to understand by most data consumers. The portals on which such visuals are hosted must be reachable to all [9] intended users. Key design principles for most OGP portals include the following features [16]: x Accessibility and Share-ability Capability x Participatory and Engagement Capability Copyright © 2017 The authors

x

Data Manipulation Capability The KNBS County Data Dissemination Portal has been designed in relation to the aforementioned OGP portal features. The technologies employed in the design and development of the KNBS Portal include: x Data Digitization, Conversion and Compilation tools: These tools have been used to liberate data locked up in various publications and other hard copy documents. The digitization and conversion processes involved transformation of scanned documents, pdf documents, and images into machine-readable formats. x Data Analytics and Web authoring tools and software: A combination of an analytics tool such as Tableau and web authoring software such as WordPress allow the design of user-friendly, mobile responsive, web-based open data portals. Such tools among others have been extensively employed in the design of the KNBS County Data visualization portal accessible via www.knbs.or.ke/visulizations. The solution available via the KNBS website offers a workflow operation that helps users to easily navigate through the data offered by the Bureau. By using filters that sort the available data by year, the user can create a time series trend on the specific datasets selected. The dashboard view helps combine multiple data sources with different types of visualizations shown on a single page tied together through interactivity. The Data manipulation capability is achieved using the filter panels on each dashboard. The filter panels enable users to further navigate the data with their own criteria, giving them greater control and flexibility. This helps them to dive into the information that is most important to them. Share-ability capability is supported through a ‘share’ feature. The ‘share’ feature provides users with an embed code and a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) link that can easily be referenced to in a web site/page, blog, etcetera. In addition, users can share a visualization via email, twitter or Facebook. The download feature allows users to download data in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file, text file, Portable Document Format (PDF) and Image formats. The technical team is in the process of completing the user data request model to provide for Participation and Engagement capabilities. Currently, new datasets requests are directed to the Bureau via their website and email and later forwarded to the portal. The different types of visualisations used to represent datasets on the KNBS County Data Dissemination Portal include: x Packed bubble charts: let you display data in a cluster of circles, i.e. the size of a bubble could show the size in population for different regions in the Country (the bigger the circle, the greater the population). They are a good choice when order of magnitude matters more than quantitative details. x Tree maps: are an excellent way to view a large number of categories in a small space with no scrolling. x Pyramid View: lets you view different demographics of age in a pyramid form. x Bar Charts: help you cluster groups of similar data against each other and derive a trend of each item over time. x Others: Pie charts and Line graphs have also been used to visualise data. Figure 1 shows a sample packed bubble chart of County Government Revenue. At a glance, you can see the best performing counties in terms of revenue collection by size of the bubble for the financial years 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. The user is given the option to view the data in four different visual formats that is, Bar Graph, Line Graph, Circle View and Packed Bubbles. A user can dive through the data using filters ‘Total Revenue’ and by ‘County’. Users can also download the data in CSV, PDF, Text file and Image formats. Copyright © 2017 The authors

5. Public-Private Partnership Framework for OGD The success of the KNBS OGD Project can be attributed to a strong framework of collaboration between the Bureau, Strathmore University and the World Bank. This partnership is within the provisions of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Act 2013, which became effective on 8th February 2014 [20]. The framework involves resources from KNBS, Strathmore University-@iLabAfrica and the World Bank working in an integrated approach to enhance KNBS data dissemination and information sharing capabilities in line with article 35 of the Constitution of Kenya, Statistics Act No. 4 2006 and the new Information Act 2016. Figure 2 illustrates the interaction between key project stakeholders. The framework recognises the importance of engaging other stakeholders especially the research and civil society, through consultative meetings and invitation to final product launches. During the launch, we had great representation from researchers in academia and business from companies like PwC, Deloitte, among other research companies, and students in undergraduate and postgraduate level from various institutions of higher learning. Also the media was well represented. In addition, the KNBS County Data Visualization Project enables the civil society groups to proactively engage with government by availing to them open government data and statistics on time in order to achieve transparency and accountability, or better service delivery to citizens.

5.2 Monitoring and Evaluation During preparation and throughout implementation, the World Bank Team works closely with, and provides on-going support to, KNBS and Strathmore University through its active participation in the Steering committee and during supervision missions. Periodical reports detailing progress during implementation are provided to the Bank by Strathmore University. The Bank is able to monitor progress against the agreed performance indicators and outcomes. Measures have been taken to ensure that all project deliverables are implemented without delay and according to schedule. This ensures that the development objectives and outcomes are achieved. 5.3 Intellectual Property In an MOU signed between KNBS and Strathmore University, the two parties agreed to protect each other’s pre-existing intellectual property rights and to accord due recognition of the property in the course of discharging obligations under the project. In case of inventions, the parties agreed to have a joint right to patent and to develop a perpetual gain-sharing model for revenues/profits/dividends associated with such. For any inventions developed independently, the two parties agreed that the intellectual property will remain with the inventing party. 5.4 Procedure to Safeguard Classified Information To ensure confidential data is kept private, only non-personal government data has been made publicly accessible via the KNBS County Data Dissemination Portal. Moreover, according to ‘Article XI: Confidentiality’ in the MOU between Strathmore University and KNBS, each party is required to protect and safeguard the other party’s Confidential Information against any unauthorized use, disclosure, report, transfer or publication with at least the same degree of care as they would for their own confidential or proprietary information, but in no event use less than reasonable care.

6. Results Over the last 1 year, visualization of development data from select KNBS publications dating from 2000 to 2015 has been done. The publications, which include the Economic Survey, Statistical Abstracts and the 2009 Census Report, have been digitized, analysed, visualised and uploaded on KNBS County Data Dissemination portal accessible via www.knbs.or.ke/visualizations. The sites’ traffic statistics show that over 250,000 global page views have been recorded since the official launch of the portal on 27th February 2015, with audience interests ranging from data on finance, economic, population, health data and agriculture. The solution visualizes several county and national statistics categorized sector wise: Agriculture, Education, Health, Public Finance and Population. An official public launch of the portal was organised at Strathmore University in February 2015. The goal was to create awareness on the existence of an open data portal to all KBNS data consumers. The affirmation of Phase 1’s success by KNBS and the World Bank and the need for a second phase was emphasised in all keynote addresses during the February 2015 official public launch of the portal. The KNBS ICT Director was happy to announce that “it is now possible to migrate the entire datasets that are in the Bureau’s Social Economic Database to a form that is more user-friendly and visualisable by users”. The Director General of KNBS echoed the same sentiments when he said that “the Bureau is very much interested to work with research institutions in the private sector so that they can disseminate better the data we (KNBS) produce to promote the use of information in decision making processes of Kenya and contribute to economic growth and development”.

The success of phase one led to the release of more funds by the World Bank to enable Strathmore University continue the work in a second Phase starting from August 2016 to July 2018. The World Bank County Director of Kenya noted, “a further deepening of citizen access to county information, including through the development of county data cell phones applications, is very much in line with the development objectives of the World Bank Country Partnership Strategy, which focuses on a transparent and accountable devolution process”. Overall, the project has increased public access to County and National Statistics in user-friendly digital format. It has also contributed to the Open Data for Business (OD4B) revolution, which has seen the birth of open data based businesses and performance improvement of existing businesses. Most importantly, KNBS’s ability to curate and upload county statistics on its website more reliably and timely continues to be strengthened. The long-term goal is to empower KNBS data producers and ICT staff with technical skills to operate and maintain the disseminations tools internally for project continuity and sustainability.

7. Benefits to Business and Society Data has become a key resource for social and commercial activities, with a quadruple effect on public/private entities, research and civil society. Governments can now unlock economic benefits from open data as the data they curate has the potential to release social and economic value through the creation of innovative businesses and services. Several studies have estimated the economic value of open data at several tens of billions of Euros annually in the EU alone [12]. 7.1 Benefits to Business and Society Noteworthy benefits of open government data to businesses (public/private), researchers and civil society as outlined in the Open Data Handbook [2][12] include: x Improved or new private products and services. x Innovation: Robinson, Yu, Zeller and Felten [14] strongly argue that open data enables the general public and private entities to engage in collective learning and garner new public innovations from the data. x Improved efficiency of government services. x Improved effectiveness of government services. x Improved transparency and accountability of local government x Available, timely and reliable data for researchers in academia and business 7.2 Benefits to KNBS x x x x

Reliable and timely data dissemination in machine-readable easy to access formats. Boosting of KNBS visibility and consumption of County and National Statistics it releases. KNBS free Staff Training and Capacity building: The KNBS Staff benefit from the technical skills and innovativeness gained through training and interaction with the Strathmore University technical team. Improved service delivery to KNBS clients: The project has increased access to Kenyan government data to both the local and global data consumers.

8. Conclusions and Recommendations The new SDGS have increased demand for data. Data development experts have acknowledged the need for strong government statistical systems with capabilities to support and monitor the SDGs [10]. In Kenya, there has been strong demand from county Copyright © 2017 The authors

governments to increase the quality and quantity of statistics available to them for policy, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of County Development Plans. In addition, Kenyan counties are by law required to establish county performance monitoring and management systems under various parts of the supporting legislation for the Constitution. Reliable and timely information is a prerequisite for such performance management systems to work. In this Data Revolution age, Public-Private Partnerships have proven effective in unlocking government data. Such partnerships allow the dedication of complementary resources from collaborating partners to unlock government data more reliably and timely in easy to access digital format. In addition, new technologies are leading to an exponential increase in the volume and types of data available, creating unprecedented possibilities for informing and transforming society and protecting the environment [11] as well as transforming democracy [19]. Also, open data initiatives are only successful if they address the data needs of key data consumers such as the research and civil society, policy makers, business, and citizens. In conclusion, the KNBS Data Dissemination Project has enabled the Bureau to package and avail public data and information to national, county and international data users in an easily accessible digital format, through research and student internship programme at Strathmore University. This project is a major contribution to OGD initiatives that seek to improve national statistical methods to collect data that can benchmark the SDGs. Recommendations The model employed in unlocking Open Government Data in the KNBS County Data Project is applicable to countries seeking to open up more government data. However, it is recommended that a proper gap analysis be done before employment of the approach discussed in this paper. A comprehensive gap analysis will allow identification of government structures and systems that need to be strengthened and/or inform on the need for policy formulation and improvement among other issues to support an open government data initiative. 8.1 Further Work Next step for the KNBS County Data Dissemination Project is to create mechanisms that will encourage more use of open government data to support the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The plan is to: x Document APIs/Web APIs x Organise National and County level Open Government Data sensitization workshops. The goal is to: o Educate citizens on the available government data to encourage more citizen participation and engagement with government; o Increase private sector awareness of government data and; o Increase the business use of government data [5].
