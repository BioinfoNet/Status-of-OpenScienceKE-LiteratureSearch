Abstract
Exchange of information within the Government is usually through formal communication such as official letters, gazette notices , internal memos, circulars, print media and also through minutes . This has not been very effective, due to lack of seamless exchange of information among Government Ministries since they work independently. The main cause being lack of an interoperable platform in terms of software which would help ease exchange of information. As a result of this, a lot of inefficiencies in service delivery to the citizenry have been experienced. This has been confirmed through ratings in performance contracting of various sectors in government over the years. In order to achieve software interoperability framework within the Government, quantitative research method was used in collaboration with other research methods such as descriptive research. The research was carried out within the National Government to ascertain various issues that relate to software interoperability with a view of developing a standard framework that will act as a guideline within the National Government. Through the research , it was possible to justify how lack of this important guideline within government has led to denial of associated benefits to the citizenry. Since there is no universal standardized software interoperability framework that any Government could directly adopt without customization, it was important to develop a software interoperability framework that is based on known user requirements within the Government of Kenya hence the need for a Software Interoperability Framework. The main objective of the research being to develop software interoperability framework between open source and proprietary software, this was accomplished by enhancing an existing software interoperability conceptual model by ATHENA consortium. The framework has further been improved by introducing various parameters and components that have a direct effect on the framework due to their interrelation nature hence making the framework more comprehensive.
