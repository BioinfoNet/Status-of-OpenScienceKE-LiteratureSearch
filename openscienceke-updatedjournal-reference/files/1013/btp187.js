Version 5 implements a number of new features and analytical methods allowing extensive DNA polymorphism analyses on large datasets. Among other features, the newly implemented methods allow for: (i) analyses on multiple data files; (ii) haplotype phasing; (iii) analyses on insertion/deletion polymorphism data; (iv) visualizing sliding window results integrated with available genome annotations in the UCSC browser.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":12023633,"mean":7.5167196189821,"rank":962456,"pct":91,"higher_than":11057443},"journal":{"count":7976,"mean":6.8462846394984,"rank":1068,"pct":86,"higher_than":6895},"similar_age_3m":{"count":147011,"mean":7.5657437045101,"rank":13313,"pct":90,"higher_than":133649},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":146,"mean":6.2679310344828,"rank":26,"pct":82,"higher_than":120}},"authors":["P.
