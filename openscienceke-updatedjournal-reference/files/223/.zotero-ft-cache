Highlights 
 
• 
 
    Three genetic lineages of O. banderanus are not consistent with recognized subspecies. 
• 
 
    Geographic boundaries limit the genetic flow among them. 
• 
 
    Molecular information suggests the presence of three independents species. 
 
Abstract 
 
Osgoodomys banderanus is a recognized and endemic rodent species of western Mexico, an area known for its high biodiversity and number of endemisms. Phylogeographical relationships within this taxon were analyzed based on mitochondrial ( ND3 , tRNA-Arginine, ND4L and partial ND4 ) and nuclear ( GHR ) nucleotide sequences. We obtained a total of 112 samples from 22 localities, covering the complete distribution of the species. Phylogenetic analyses using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference confirmed that Osgoodomys is a monophyletic group. In addition, phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses detected three major clades, which do not coincide with the recognized subspecies of O. banderanus . The genetic lineages detected are the western clade (Nayarit, Jalisco and northern Colima), the central clade (Colima, Michoacán, and northern Guerrero) and the eastern clade (central and southern Guerrero). Genetic distances among clades (5–9%) and nucleotide substitutions (30–88) among haplogroups were high, especially in the southern group. Mountain ranges such as the Transmexican Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Madre del Sur, as well as the Balsas River act as geographical barriers for Osgoodomys . Our results suggest the presence of three independent species, which need to be characterized morphologically to confirm our hypothesis.
