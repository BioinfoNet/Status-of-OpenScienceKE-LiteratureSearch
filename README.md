# Status of Open Science in Kenya: Literature Search

The aim of this team is to scan through public databases for literature, or material that would shed light on the adoption and practice of Open Science in Kenya.

Our findings will be organized into a report that will contribute to the greater OpenScienceKE project that is to assess the status of Open Science in Kenya.

## Members of Our Team

As we prepare to make our big contributions on August 30th and 31st, you are welcome to make inputs/comments.

Suggest sources we can search from and search strategies. 

Meanwhile, you can keep contemplating your inputs, keeping in mind that we shall discuss strategies at the start of the hackathon as per the [Hackathon schedule](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon/blob/master/hackathonschedule.md)

## Search Examples
In this repository is also a short code based on the NCBI EDirect tool for PubMed search. A ```Search.md``` file describes the code and two test result files are also included, containing PMIDs for papers that are associated with Kenyan researchers [testResult_1.txt](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/Status-of-OpenScienceKE-LiteratureSearch/blob/master/testResult_1.txt) and/or Kenyan institutions [testResult_2.txt](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/Status-of-OpenScienceKE-LiteratureSearch/blob/master/testResult_2.txt)
