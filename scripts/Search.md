# Potential Strategies and Sources for Literature Search
Proper scanning for literature on Open Science in Kenya will require robust search strategies and particularly careful choice of keywords.

A great place to start would be the 'Open Science facets as a beehive' from FOSTER (https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/content/what-open-science-introduction)

## Search Terms/Keywords
Using the Open Science terms on the figure as keywords, we could search various literature databases for Open Science Papers in general.

Then, using specific filters, we could fine-tune our search to include only papers published by researchers in Kenyan institutions.

This may require some processing. You are welcome to suggest advanced search or filter options.

## Some Places to Look
* [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)
* [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)(PMC)
* [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/)(DOAJ)
* [JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/)
* [SCOPUS](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus)/ELSEVIER
* [African Journas Online](https://www.ajol.info/)
* [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
* [BioOne](http://www.bioone.org/)
* [Bioinformatic Harvester](https://links.bioinformatics.ca/links_directory/tool/9872/harvester)
* [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/)
* [Google Scolar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* [GoPubMed](https://library.tmc.edu/database/gopubmed/)
* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)
* [ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/)
* [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/)/ELSEVIER
* [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/)

### Searching the PubMed and PMC databases for Open Science papers with Affiliations to Kenyan institutions

```
$ esearch -db pubmed -query "open science[keyword] OR \
	open source[keyword] OR \
	open data[keyword] OR \
	open access[keyword] OR \
	open peer review[keyword] OR \
	open review[keyword] OR \
	open notebooks[keyword] OR \
	open educational resources[keyword] OR \
	open resource[keyword] OR \
	citizen science[keyword] OR \
	scientific social network[keyword]" |
  efetch -format xml | xtract...
```

This code searchers the PubMed database for the papers with the various keywords and pipes the search result into the ```xtract``` command

NCBI's EDirect tool for Unix environments can extract valuable information from xml files.

### Running for loops with Open Science keywords against the PubMed database

A count of the PubMed search results for the corresponding keywords

```
$ for kwd in \
	"open science" \
	"open source" \
	"open data" \
	"open code" \
	"open access" \
	"open peer review" \
	"open review" \
	"open notebooks" \
	"open educational resources" \
	"open resource" \
	"citizen science" \
	"scientific social network"
  do 
	esearch -db pubmed -query "$kwd[keyword]" |
	efetch -format uid | 
	wc -l > keyCounts.txt
  done
```

### Extracting PMIDS, Journal titles, and Author LastNames of each paper, and their respective affiliations into tab separated columns

```
$ for kwd in \
	"open science" \
	"open source" \
	"open data" \
	"open code" \
	"open access" \
	"open peer review" \
	"open review" \
	"open notebooks" \
	"open educational resources" \
	"open resource" \
	"citizen science" \
	"scientific social network"
  do 
	esearch -db pubmed -query "$kwd[keyword]" |
	efetch -format xml |
	xtract -pattern MedlineCitation -sep "\t" -element MedlineCitation/PMID, Journal/Title -block Author -sep "\t" -element LastName, Affiliation |
```

The result of this code is piped into the next command

### Printing all lines of papers with author affiliations in Kenya. These would represent open science studies with Kenyan affiliate(s) whether conducted at a Kenyan institution or not

```
$ grep "Kenya" | 
```

The result of this command is piped into the next command

### Printing and saving the PubMed ID of such papers in a pmids.txt file for subsequent abstract/full text retrieval

```
$ awk '{print $1}' > testResult_1.txt
```

### Extracting all PMIDS, Journal titles, the last names of only first authors of each paper, and their respetive affiliations into tab separated columns

```
$ xtract -pattern PubmedArticle -sep "\t" -element MedlineCitation/PMID, Journal/Title, -first Author Affiliation |
```

### Print only lines with first authors in Kenyan institutions. This would represent Open Science studies conducted at Kenyan institutions

```
$ grep "Kenya"
```

### Print the PubMed ID of such papers

```
$ awk '{print $1}' > testResult_2.txt

done
```

### Articles in the Open Access (OA) subset of PubMed Central (PMC)

```
$ esearch -db pmc -query "open access[filter]" |
  efetch -format uid > pmcid.txt
```

After running this code, we should be able to retrieve the papers from PubMed.

## Code
Please refer to the ```Search.sh``` file for the code.

To be able to run this code you will need to install the EDirect tool [here](https://github.com/esohkevin/OpenScienceKEHackathon/blob/master/EDirect.md)
