Looking at podcasts and vlogs is only a fair short at giving the capture of Open Science discussions in Kenya a wide coverage.
The founder of Data Science LTD, Kenya, Linet Kwamboka was part of a Video discussion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV5icU3qvgw) 
with Samuel Lee and Sandra Moscoso of the World Bank Group Open Finances on the use of Open Data in development.
Her company does data analytics research and tries to get people appreciate the power of data for data-driven decision making.
Their research depends on the Kenya Open Data Initiative which makes the Government data to the public free and accessible and they advocate the
[importance of Open Data in business](https://medium.com/@DataSciencing/why-is-open-data-important-for-your-business-d77c11ecf948).

[Kenya Open Data Initiative](https://www.opendata.go.ke/) is a portal of the Kenya ICT Authority incharge of making public 
Government research accessible to the public.

It provides several categories of data including Agriculture, Education, Environment, Energy, Finance, Governance, Government Accounts, 
Health, Infrastructure, Population and Census, Water and Sanitation and per County data is also provided.

The discussions about setting up Kenya Open Data date back to 2010 according to Kaburo Kobia who helped manage the program at its inception in the Kenya ICT board.
She recounted her experience in a video interview with [Open Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Ywcyz3_Z0).

According to K24TV's 2012 report published on their YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdf7-iZBweE), not all government data was "openly available".
Matters of national security were thought to be the major confounding factor.

Dr. Bitange Ndemo, in his interveiw with South Africa's SABC Digital News, expressed great confidence in the use of Open Data and its potential to 
increase accountability and hence help the fight of corruption in Africa.

In 2015, [OpenCon](https://www.opencon2018.org/lilian/opencon_2015_nairobi) organized an Open Science conference at the Kenyatta University in which
the importance of Open Access, Open Data and Open Education in Kenya were discussed.
