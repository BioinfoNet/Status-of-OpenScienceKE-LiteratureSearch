Daily nation article **Researchers will no longer have to jump impossible hoops set up by international journals** Vera okeyo reported that , in May,2018 during a science conference in Ghana,researchers from Kenya and other african countries had a debate on **open access publishing**.some of the researchers supported open access publishing saying that it would  reduce the cost of publishing especially if the research is funded by the tax payers.Their main concern was the high cost of subscription has made many scientists not  to access their previously published research in the traditional journals, hence there are many replicated research which has previously being done because the scientists had no idea that the research already existed. 

The scientist who were opposing the open access platform, main concern was that their credibility and  career growth is bound to the types of journals they publish in. most scientists careers rely on the number  of citation their papers have  and open access journals are not discernable to this type of tracking.
