Abstract:  	Terrestrial carbon stock estimates information has signi cant importance in planning decisions for amicable mitigation of global warming and climate change related disasters. However, conventional estimation methods are usually expensive and time demanding particularly on national or regional scales. Therefore, this study sought to estimate and analyze carbon stock changes in Kenya as a consequence of land cover change (LCC) using open data and software to provide a ordable and timely solutions. Using Random Forest (RF) decision trees, the land cover for 2028 was modelled from 2004 and 2016 land cover under Business as Usual (BAU) and an alternative, Reducing of Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation (REDD+) scenarios. The modelled land cover maps were thereafter input in InVEST carbon model for estimation and valuation of carbon stock between 2004 and 2028. The results show a 16% decline in carbon stock between 2004 and 2028 with a likelihood of losing up to 21 billion US$ under BAU scenario at a national level. On a regional scale, the results revealed a gradual decline in carbon stock in the Coastal and Central regions of the study area while other regions exhibited mixed results. However, the trend can be reversed by implementation of REDD+ scenario with a possible increase of 1.6% between 2016 and 2028, translating to a gain of approximately 1 billion US$. This study contributes to the understanding of spatiotemporal carbon stock changes under di erent scenarios for e ective spatial planning, land use policy development and keeping balances during natural resource utilization.
