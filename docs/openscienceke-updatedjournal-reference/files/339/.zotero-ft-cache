Summary

Web-accessible germplasm databases allow stakeholders to interactively search and locate information in real time. These databases can also be configured to permit designated users to remotely add, delete, or update information. These resources assist in decision-making activities that are related to germplasm documentation, conservation, and management. We report the development of a web-accessible database of Kenyan sweetpotato ( Ipomoea batatas ) varieties using open source software. Kenya is located in eastern Africa, a region that is considered one of the centers of diversity for sweetpotato. We describe the software applications used in developing the germplasm database as well as the web interface for displaying and interactively searching records. This report demonstrates that open source software can be used in developing a web-enabled database with management features similar to those found in proprietary or commercial applications.
