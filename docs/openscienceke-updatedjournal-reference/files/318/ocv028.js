It was used for collection of standardized data from case records of multiple hospitals' pediatric wards. R, an open-source statistical language, was used for data quality enhancement, analysis, and report generation for the hospitals.\nIn the first year of CIN, the authors have developed innovative solutions to support the implementation of a secure, rapid pediatric data collection system spanning 14 hospital sites with stringent data quality checks. Data have been collated on over 37 000 admission episodes, with considerable improvement in clinical documentation of admissions observed. Using meta-programming techniques in R, coupled with branching logic, randomization, data lookup, and Application Programming Interface (API) features offered by REDCap, CDM tasks were configured and automated to ensure quality data was delivered for clinical improvement and research use.\nA low-cost clinically focused but geographically dispersed quality CDM (Clinical Data Management) in a long-term, multi-site, and real world context can be achieved and sustained and challenges can be overcome through thoughtful design and implementation of open-source tools for handling data and supporting research.","context":{"all":{"count":10479368,"mean":7.3671302982233,"rank":2060478,"pct":80,"higher_than":8410741},"journal":{"count":1857,"mean":10.87875,"rank":705,"pct":61,"higher_than":1148},"similar_age_3m":{"count":227684,"mean":8.6960520723991,"rank":50792,"pct":77,"higher_than":176646},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":58,"mean":39.685087719298,"rank":37,"pct":36,"higher_than":21}},"authors":["Timothy Tuti","Michael Bitok","Chris Paton","Boniface Makone","Lucas Malla","Naomi Muinga","David Gathara","Mike English","Tuti, Timothy","Bitok, Michael","Paton, Chris","Makone, Boniface","Malla, Lucas","Muinga, Naomi","Gathara, David","English, Mike"],"type":"article","altmetric_id":4129997,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":11,"cited_by_tweeters_count":8,"cited_by_accounts_count":10,"last_updated":1510045806,"score":5.5,"history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocv028","added_on":1433946143,"published_on":1433894400,"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"readers":{"citeulike":"0","mendeley":"64","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":64,"images":{"small":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=6&types=ttttttff","medium":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=6&types=ttttttff","large":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=6&types=ttttttff"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4129997"})
