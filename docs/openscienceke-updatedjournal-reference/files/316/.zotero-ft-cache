Abstract

8,9 initiative has collated useful material. The FOSSFA site10 includes an installation of Care2X for review, and the Regenstrief Institute in the United States of Amercia has begun work on a up-to-date FOSS system at Eldoret in northern Kenya. But these are early days in the development of FOSS for Health in Africa. However, given that the cost constraints under which health and ICT have to work, there are likely to be many health facilities and organisations wondering if they should go FOSS, and perhaps Governments too will be considering whether they should switch to using OSS11 – the United Kingdom, for example has adopted a policy to consider open-source solutions alongside proprietary ones in IT procurement.12 The AIC Kijabe Hospital
