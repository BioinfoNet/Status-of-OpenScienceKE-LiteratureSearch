dc.description.abstract 	The Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology (JKUAT) Open Access Week took place from the 15-22 October and was a huge success. By partnering with JKUAT students, who brought in the necessary energy and creativity, we successfully carried out all of the planned activities. A major contribution from the students came in making the site visible, as they designed promotional posters, invitation cards, bandanas, name tags and a banner that was mounted at the University’s main gate. 	en_US
