Abstract

Open Source Software (OSS) has emerged as an alternative to Closed Source Software in many fields of software usage. However, how and why OSS software is being adopted and implemented within organizations in Kenya is not well documented. This study attempts to advance this understanding. Survey and interview were used to explore and distinguish the types, level and factors determining adoption of OSS. The results obtained show that 60 % of respondent organizations were adopting some form of OSS. OSS was preferred to CSS due to control over the software and the cost of acquiring and running the software. CSS was preferred due to quality of support from vendors, ease of use and fashion trend. Both were at par in terms of scalability, reliability, security features, functionality and integration with other systems.
