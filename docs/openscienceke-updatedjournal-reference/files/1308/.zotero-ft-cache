    The Journal of Negro Education
    Description: The Journal of Negro Education ( JNE ), a refereed scholarly periodical, was founded at Howard University in 1932 to fill the need for a scholarly journal that would identify and define the problems that characterized the education of Black people in the United States and elsewhere, provide a forum for analysis and solutions, and serve as a vehicle for sharing statistics and research on a national basis. JNE sustains a commitment to a threefold mission: first, to stimulate the collection and facilitate the dissemination of facts about the education of Black people; second, to present discussions involving critical appraisals of the proposals and practices relating to the education of Black people; and third, to stimulate and sponsor investigations of issues incident to the education of Black people.
    Coverage: 1932-2019 (Vol. 1, No. 1 - Vol. 88, No. 2)
    Moving Wall: 3 years (What is the moving wall?)

    The "moving wall" represents the time period between the last issue available in JSTOR and the most recently published issue of a journal. Moving walls are generally represented in years. In rare instances, a publisher has elected to have a "zero" moving wall, so their current issues are available in JSTOR shortly after publication.
    Note: In calculating the moving wall, the current year is not counted.
    For example, if the current year is 2008 and a journal has a 5 year moving wall, articles from the year 2002 are available.

    Terms Related to the Moving Wall
        Fixed walls: Journals with no new volumes being added to the archive.
        Absorbed: Journals that are combined with another title.
        Complete: Journals that are no longer published or that have been combined with another title.

“Open Access” and the Fate of Knowledge from Africa: A Theoretical Discussion
Preview not available
Abstract
Open Access, is often understood as referring to the free circulation of research outputs from and to all parts of the planet. It is argued that this definition is deceptive because it ignores the fact that the imposition of the epistemological paradigm of the hegemonic culture on the indigenous people of Africa translates to the partial destruction of their epistemological paradigm. The thesis that this author defends is that Open Access ought to be preceded by the “open production of knowledge.” This is necessary so that the research that becomes freely available globally through Open Access genuinely reflects the diversity of its knowledges and producers.
